 So, like, what's your favorite book or like movie? Um, so I don't, I haven't read an actual story or like a book book in a while. Um, but recently I've read like the alchemist. I don't know if you've heard of it. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, what do you think of it? I haven't finished it yet. I'm still like in the middle of, but. I mean, I think I read it a few years ago. So, like, I don't remember every detail, but I remember that like it was philosophical. And like, I, I'm like found some coast that like resonated. Um, I remember that I took some notes from that book, like from a, like, from a not from my personal book. I mean, um, so like life lessons kind of thing. Okay. That's cool. That's dope. Um, yeah. Um, it seems very philosophical. I mean, I've, I got it from old high school teacher. And he said that in the mail. So it was very nice to see that. Um, but yeah, I'm not. Don't really read as many books. I do watch a lot of movies and TV shows. Um, what movies are you into? Um, like my, my favorite movie is Harry Potter. Like I really like Harry Potter. And I read the read the books when I was a child, but like, you know, watching the movies and I like when I got bored or just like, when I felt like I want to watch it again. Um, so like, it's my favorite from also I didn't like a lot of the musical. Um, the what? Do you know that's? I'm not too sure. I know that I know definitely know how you feel about Harry Potter. Sure. Um, because similar to me, I like also read the books that Harry Potter like third, fourth grade and then I'm watching the movies, getting a Lego set for them for my birthday. Like, um, it was, I enjoy Harry Potter a lot. And it's always like, um, like you said, it's like the field and movie. If you want to watch it in your free time or something, you just put it on and start watching it. Um, yeah, I guess like similar Harry Potter, like there's those big blockbuster cash money movies like. Um, the Marvels Avengers and then Star Wars and then a bunch of Disney movies like. Um, I know I always watched Reddit, to me. Or over the hedge robots. A monster zinc, like, incredible. All these kind of good movies that. It's good entertainment all the time. Also, I like shake and I say. Mm hmm. Shrek and I say you're really good ones too. Um, it's weird saying that when you're older too. It's like you see a lot of jokes that you didn't realize were in them, especially Shrek. Yes. Wow. Thanks. I don't like social jokes as well. So like, and like when I watched the child, I can catch them. And I watched it again. Here I go. Like, I was like, Oh, okay. Yeah. Wow. It's not as innocent as I thought. I mean, I feel the same way with, um, music. Because when music is like, like, I don't know growing up, I listen to a lot of people. And I was like, wow, that's what it's actually about. I thought he was just wanting to have a good time, but. Right, Lee Hotel room is different. So, you know, it's like. Different meetings start to realize it, but still entertaining, just as it was. Yeah. Yeah. Do you watch a lot of TV shows along with movies? Um, I watched how I met her mother. Why, like, um, Bridget and the Queen Scambits. Okay. Yeah. What about you? I feel like my TV shows are very on the opposite side where I watched like the boys. I don't know if you've heard of it, the Amazon. It's very, like graphic superhero bag, I kind of thing. thing. So I wouldn't recommend it if you don't like too much of just everything over stimulation. But it's fun. What else do I like? I watch a lot of like Japanese shows like anime and stuff too. And just like a bunch of international TV shows too because different, it's fun to see like different cultures and what they have, what's their mainstream media. So that's interesting to me too. I think I haven't watched anime before. I usually watch what I find on Netflix and like I don't like try to find any other source much like you do with international TV shows. I think it's I mean, obviously growing up it's like you're looking at one area in Netflix but then you start to branch out and you see like differences of what cultures find as normal entertainment versus like what on the Western civilization you find there's normal entertainment. So it's very cool to see. I know a lot of hype has been around like I don't know if you heard attack on Titan. But it's like another anime that's like massive right now. So it's very I would recommend that one. But that's also very can be very graphic too. So I don't know. Yeah, I feel like my my sense of media is really one side like like the races and the TV shows and like the storyline. Like since I'm just like using one broadcast like I'm watching from Netflix most of the time. Like there are there's a lot of similarities among them. So like I do you do find it as a like do you want to like branch out or is it just you're fine with what it is or actually I would like to like reach out but like during the school time it's hard to do that. It's just easier to open Netflix and like it's my comfort zone. Like yeah, just like I'm just I don't know it's easier to do that other than just trying to find other any other shows because I always have hard time finding it like for example if I wanted to watch a movie I sometimes spend a couple of minutes or sometimes half an hour to just like try to find the movie that I'm on the watch. So instead of that like I open them and continue to show the time already I've been watching it's easier. Yeah, I definitely feel that we start looking for a movie at 6 30 we don't find a movie to 10 30 like it's always that case. Like you just want to switch what's worth our time and in the end there's only no movie that playing. But yeah, I definitely agree. A lot of times it's very hard to watch something during like school and when stuff kicks out. So I guess like another term of entertainment would be like music. You know it's not on music because that's like something you can do while you're doing schoolwork. Actually like I can't listen to music while I'm studying it just this fact but like I like listening to music for example while I'm trying my hair or like or like while I'm cleaning my room. Like and I think I mostly listen to pop music. I also like listening to Beyonce, Shakira, like some songs. Yeah, I realize that like when I listen to some songs I feel also a little bit down. So like when I want to listen to music I just try to hype myself up by like it's a more energetic songs. What about you? I kind of listen to like everything all over. I'm doing homework. I listen to more like R&B, like chill when I'm with like people outside. I'll listen to like pop pop music rep and then you got your dance like Latina, Latin hop and then like Afro beat sometimes. And then like this weekend we went to the Diwali celebration and we listened to Indian music and Hollywood music. So it's kind of all over the place. So I guess it's just very dependent on what I'm doing and what my mood is. Yeah. But I guess I feel it sentiment when you said like you can't figure out music to like listen to when you're studying. That's a very hard thing to figure out. But yeah, I think for me it's just like the chill more relaxed music is what I can listen to as in background noise while I'm doing the work. Actually like it's easier to focus on my work when I and listen to the music at the same time while I'm doing math or like something stem related. But like for example, if I'm writing a paper that's almost impossible for me to just like focus on the paper and listen to the music at the same time. That's a good topic as well. Yeah, that's fair because I think with the lyrics involved while you're writing it's like over simulation but math is numbers and x plus y plus z you know so you can listen music into that.
