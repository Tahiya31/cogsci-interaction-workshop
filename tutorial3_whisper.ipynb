    "## Whisper tutorial notebook: Transcript\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an introduction to [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper/tree/main), a tool for detecting signals and features for emotion recognition from speech audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can be used to transcribe speech of varying length.\n",
    "* It is very accurate and pretty fast.\n",
    "* It is multilingual!\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "* It outputs transcripts in ~30 second segments. So it might cut off the speaker mid-turn, mid-utterance or mid-word.\n",
    "* It does not provide phoneme or word-level time alignments. So if you need that, this is not for you (but we know of things that might work for you! Come see us!).\n",
    "* The authors of whisper say they trained on 680,000 hours of speech+text collected from the internet. However, they don't indicate which speech, from where, transcribed by whom, or with whose consent. \n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about whisper, please refer to the [github repo](https://github.com/openai/whisper/tree/main)."

      " I guess maybe just to start broadly, like what are your favorite forms of like consuming entertainment? I mean, music, like I listen to a lot of music. It's like movies. I don't really watch a lot of TV, honestly, but I like some TV shows. And yeah, where are you? For me, it's like definitely like before college, like a lot of video games, but since getting to college more, it's more like social media and like occasionally like TV movies and then definitely a good bit of music as well. So I guess what kind of music do you listen to? Cause I feel like you can probably find something and comment there. Yeah. Okay, well like a lot. So I mean, like mostly like rap and like I think that's been like some, some like indie, some kind of like, not country, but also like some Latin music. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But you know, so just like, like popular like rap songs and like old, like old, like old, I thought too. What are you? Yeah. No, that lines up for me. Like, um, I mean, for instance, I like, I went to, um, you said it indie, like a bit of indie, right? Well, but yeah. This is more like indie pop kind of stuff, but I went to the Clara concert in Boston the other night. So I don't know if you listen to Clara at all, but. Yeah. Yeah. A little bit. Yeah. Who would you like, who would you say you listened to more and like rap and stuff? Like, especially with like newer rap? Uh, I mean, like, there's like different, I was like, like, young boy and like, co-i-art and like, oh, that's it. And like, also like, I don't know. I've been like a really big family. I feel like a long time. That's really cool. That's awesome. Yeah. You listen to Tyler? I listen to a bit of Tyler. I feel like I feel like I could be more like, I feel like I could be much like, much better, like, not educated, but like, I've been like more knowing about like his stuff and like more like, but into it, but I definitely like, I'm like, I know about like his stuff and I've listened to a lot of his stuff and I have enjoyed it. Like, I really, like this is like, I don't know. I feel like a lot of like diehard Tyler fans, possibly you included my like, like not like me for this, but I feel like I'm most like flower boy and like, Igor and. Yeah. And yeah, I don't know. I feel like I know a lot of people like disagree with that and like wolf or whatever, you know. Well, I mean, people that, yeah, people are like annoying about it. It's like, that's stupid. Yeah. I was like, I love Frank Ocean and I love Kanye, honestly. Yeah. Yeah. I think with the whole Kanye's like the drama, I feel like I just choose to ignore a lot of that, like in terms of like enjoying his music. I mean, obviously like, it's something that needs to pay attention to and like, maybe he needs help honestly, but like, you know, I think like, because I think he has like a lot of like, yes, men in his corner, basically, that are like, allowing this kind of behavior to like, become public, but I don't know. Overall, I mean, just like enjoy the music. I feel like I kind of just like choose to ignore a lot of that kind of stuff. Yeah. Do you think like separate the artists from like their creation or whatever? I mean, I think in that circumstance, yes, I think it's certain circumstances. It's hard to do that. If someone did something like if people do things to like, that are just such like a far extended sometimes hard to do that. But I feel like, I don't know, it's hard to do that just like across the board, because there are certain like artists that like, I just enjoy their music so much that it's really hard for me. Like, you know, prioritize like my moral qualms with them. Like, like one instance of that, which is like a pretty crazy instance, because what the guy did, but like take a, I don't know a lot of his music. He's just like, really still really nice to listen to, even though he literally like murdered someone. Yeah. You know, it's like, you know, it's something you can really, I don't know if you know, take it off, but like, I mean, he's like literally, I think he's literally serving a life sentence. If I, you know, if I remember correctly. Yeah. So. But I don't know. It's like, it's hard though. What do you think about like separating art and artists? Yeah. I mean, I do that like with Kanye's question is like, it's hard to defend it, but it's like, it's, it's so much pitch. And like, with like future to like, you know, like preaches like. I don't know. He has so many kids, he just like doesn't take care of it. It's just a terrible father, but like, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was going to say, definitely like the, you know, there was all those memes. I forget exactly what it was, but you know what, like the, like format of what it was, but it was like, you know, calling him like, you know, like CEO of Masakhini and shit, which is just like, definitely like poking fun at it. And then it was also like the people who are like creating and consuming those steps and memes are the same people are like listening to this music. So it's like really. Commonation. Yeah. I guess maybe to like pivot to movies, because I haven't seen that many movies recently. But I definitely have seen it. I've seen a couple that I really enjoyed. Like, I really enjoy the new Spider-Man movie, which is obviously very like mainstream, but I don't know. I really like that. Right as it came out, because my friend like dragged me to it. Yeah. But I really, I really like super like knowledgeable about like Marvel and stuff. Yes. I was like the first Marvel, or I don't know if it was the first Marvel movie, but like, I just don't want to. So I was kind of confused, but just like. Like I. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Like I've seen a couple more movies. Besides that, but that was it. And I don't really know a lot about like the whole world besides like, you know, like popular culture, like memes and stuff, you know, like end game and stuff like that. Like I know certain things because of like. The way that like social media portrays them, but like I haven't actually like seen a lot of that stuff and like. Thought about it, you know, like I saw like one Thor movie, you know, and then. I saw, you know, I saw Spider-Man and I think I seen like one other Marvel movie that I saw. And then one other Marvel movie besides that before seeing that Spider-Man movie. So. Yeah, that was definitely like a big. Like thing to like not know what I was what was happening really. And I'm kind of going into the same thing with a DC movie today. I'm going to go see Batman with my friend. My friend, my friend, my friend, we're dragging me to that. Yeah. Yeah, I want to see that. It's like these people realize the little Easter eggs are like the things that like. The patterns that they put in all their movies, but like whatever. Yeah, for sure. And so it's like three hours. I don't know. I don't know what's going to go on in that movie, but I think I'm hoping it's good. It's supposed to be decent. So. Yeah. I used to be like a huge Batman family. Really. Yeah, I like listening to your own movies. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you were bigger into Batman than any other like Superman or any other like superhero stuff. Yeah. I was a younger, but I was like really. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know how that came about? That's like interesting to me. He said like he's never seemed like like the coolest or like the most like standout like one to me. Yeah. I think it was just like all of his like all the like gadgets and shit like battlefields like so since. Yeah. You just had all the coolest like like the bat like stars. Like through like the suit suits. Yeah. For sure. I don't know. I like never got into superheroes. My like when I was a kid like for me, it was like a lot of like. I was big into like Harry Potter and like Percy Jackson. And like Star Wars. Those are like my big three. Like that. Like stars. You've never seen Star Wars. Like not really. I think I've seen like one of them or something. I mean, I think that like it definitely gets it's like it gets so much hype and I think that it's definitely not for everyone for the amount of hype it gets. But you know, I feel like certain people like it definitely like candy boring at times, you know, for some people like I know. But like, you know, with like the first the first three movies as in like first three episodes, not first three ones that were released. But like overall, I don't know, I feel like it's just something that's like worth watching at like one point in your life because like for some people it's like. So interesting and like really like it's such a big draw and I feel like it's like worth it to try it. Yeah, I mean, it definitely it's like kind of huge impact on like top culture. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Like I, and the thing is too like I got interested in it. Like not even by watching the original movies like the first movie I ever watched was episode one, not episode four, which is like. Episode one's the fourth one ever released. I don't know how much you know about like the way that they were came out. Like the like the three original movies that came out like they were a trilogy. I mean they've released all the movies as trilogy but it was a trilogy but in terms of like the way that it works. Promologically in that universe. It's the first three movies that are released are actually like movies four or five and six like in terms of like how the storyline progresses. And then they released one, two, three, and then they released Disney then released seven, eight, nine. Yeah. But I don't know. I feel like I feel like Disney's kind of ruined it. I feel like with Marvel they've actually done it seems like people fans are pretty happy with that what they've done with Marvel but I think with Star Wars people want me to like what they've done. I don't know. I don't know. That has been different but it has been so. Yeah. I'm going to cut you guys off there times up. Before you have your next conversation you'll just need to answer a few questions. So please move back to the computer and navigate back to the survey and answer the three questions. Once you've done that navigate back to the zoom window and let me know as soon as you're done by coming back to the blue chair.\n",

Uh, I mean, like, there's like different, I was like, like, young boy and like, co-i-art and like, oh, that's it. And like, also like, I don't know. I've been like a really big family. I feel like a long time. That's really cool. That's awesome. Yeah. You listen to Tyler? I listen to a bit of Tyler. I feel like I feel like I could be more like, I feel like I could be much like, much better, like, not educated, but like, I've been like more knowing about like his stuff and like more like, but into it, but I definitely like, I'm like, I know about like his stuff and I've listened to a lot of his stuff and I have enjoyed it. Like, I really, like this is like, I don't know. I feel like a lot of like diehard Tyler fans, possibly you included my like, like not like me for this, but I feel like I'm most like flower boy and like, Igor and. Yeah. And yeah, I don't know. I feel like I know a lot of people like disagree with that and like wolf or whatever, you know. Well, I mean, people that, yeah, people are like annoying about it. It's like, that's stupid. Yeah. I was like, I love Frank Ocean and I love Kanye, honestly. Yeah. Yeah. I think with the whole Kanye's like the drama, I feel like I just choose to ignore a lot of that, like in terms of like enjoying his music. I mean, obviously like, it's something that needs to pay attention to and like, maybe he needs help honestly, but like, you know, I think like, because I think he has like a lot of like, yes, men in his corner, basically, that are like, allowing this kind of behavior to like, become public, but I don't know. Overall, I mean, just like enjoy the music. I feel like I kind of just like choose to ignore a lot of that kind of stuff. Yeah. Do you think like separate the artists from like their creation or whatever? I mean, I think in that circumstance, yes, I think it's certain circumstances. It's hard to do that. If someone did something like if people do things to like, that are just such like a far extended sometimes hard to do that. But I feel like, I don't know, it's hard to do that just like across the board, because there are certain like artists that like, I just enjoy their music so much that it's really hard for me. Like, you know, prioritize like my moral qualms with them. Like, like one instance of that, which is like a pretty crazy instance, because what the guy did, but like take a, I don't know a lot of his music. He's just like, really still really nice to listen to, even though he literally like murdered someone. Yeah. You know, it's like, you know, it's something you can really, I don't know if you know, take it off, but like, I mean, he's like literally, I think he's literally serving a life sentence. If I, you know, if I remember correctly. Yeah. So. But I don't know. It's like, it's hard though. What do you think about like separating art and artists? Yeah. I mean, I do that like with Kanye's question is like, it's hard to defend it, but it's like, it's, it's so much pitch. And like, with like future to like, you know, like preaches like. I don't know. He has so many kids, he just like doesn't take care of it. It's just a terrible father, but like, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was going to say, definitely like the, you know, there was all those memes. I forget exactly what it was, but you know what, like the, like format of what it was, but it was like, you know, calling him like, you know, like CEO of Masakhini and shit, which is just like, definitely like poking fun at it. And then it was also like the people who are like creating and consuming those steps and memes are the same people are like listening to this music. So it's like really. Commonation. Yeah. I guess maybe to like pivot to movies, because I haven't seen that many movies recently. But I definitely have seen it. I've seen a couple that I really enjoyed. Like, I really enjoy the new Spider-Man movie, which is obviously very like mainstream, but I don't know. I really like that. Right as it came out, because my friend like dragged me to it. Yeah. But I really, I really like super like knowledgeable about like Marvel and stuff. Yes. I was like the first Marvel, or I don't know if it was the first Marvel movie, but like, I just don't want to. So I was kind of confused, but just like. Like I. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Like I've seen a couple more movies. Besides that, but that was it. And I don't really know a lot about like the whole world besides like, you know, like popular culture, like memes and stuff, you know, like end game and stuff like that. Like I know certain things because of like. The way that like social media portrays them, but like I haven't actually like seen a lot of that stuff and like. Thought about it, you know, like I saw like one Thor movie, you know, and then. I saw, you know, I saw Spider-Man and I think I seen like one other Marvel movie that I saw. And then one other Marvel movie besides that before seeing that Spider-Man movie. So. Yeah, that was definitely like a big. Like thing to like not know what I was what was happening really. And I'm kind of going into the same thing with a DC movie today. I'm going to go see Batman with my friend. My friend, my friend, my friend, we're dragging me to that. Yeah. Yeah, I want to see that. It's like these people realize the little Easter eggs are like the things that like. The patterns that they put in all their movies, but like whatever. Yeah, for sure. And so it's like three hours. I don't know. I don't know what's going to go on in that movie, but I think I'm hoping it's good. It's supposed to be decent. So. Yeah. I used to be like a huge Batman family. Really. Yeah, I like listening to your own movies. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you were bigger into Batman than any other like Superman or any other like superhero stuff. Yeah. I was a younger, but I was like really. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know how that came about? That's like interesting to me. He said like he's never seemed like like the coolest or like the most like standout like one to me. Yeah. I think it was just like all of his like all the like gadgets and shit like battlefields like so since. Yeah. You just had all the coolest like like the bat like stars. Like through like the suit suits. Yeah. For sure. I don't know. I like never got into superheroes. My like when I was a kid like for me, it was like a lot of like. I was big into like Harry Potter and like Percy Jackson. And like Star Wars. Those are like my big three. Like that. Like stars. You've never seen Star Wars. Like not really. I think I've seen like one of them or something. I mean, I think that like it definitely gets it's like it gets so much hype and I think that it's definitely not for everyone for the amount of hype it gets. But you know, I feel like certain people like it definitely like candy boring at times, you know, for some people like I know. But like, you know, with like the first the first three movies as in like first three episodes, not first three ones that were released. But like overall, I don't know, I feel like it's just something that's like worth watching at like one point in your life because like for some people it's like. So interesting and like really like it's such a big draw and I feel like it's like worth it to try it. Yeah, I mean, it definitely it's like kind of huge impact on like top culture. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Like I, and the thing is too like I got interested in it. Like not even by watching the original movies like the first movie I ever watched was episode one, not episode four, which is like. Episode one's the fourth one ever released. I don't know how much you know about like the way that they were came out. Like the like the three original movies that came out like they were a trilogy. I mean they've released all the movies as trilogy but it was a trilogy but in terms of like the way that it works. Promologically in that universe. It's the first three movies that are released are actually like movies four or five and six like in terms of like how the storyline progresses. And then they released one, two, three, and then they released Disney then released seven, eight, nine. Yeah. But I don't know. I feel like I feel like Disney's kind of ruined it. I feel like with Marvel they've actually done it seems like people fans are pretty happy with that what they've done with Marvel but I think with Star Wars people want me to like what they've done. I don't know. I don't know. That has been different but it has been so. Yeah. I'm going to cut you guys off there times up. Before you have your next conversation you'll just need to answer a few questions. So please move back to the computer and navigate back to the survey and answer the three questions. Once you've done that navigate back to the zoom window and let me know as soon as you're done by coming back to the blue chair.\n",

      " I don't hear any particular type of music. It really depends on my mood. So I would say mostly music, but about you. So for me, it honestly depends on my mood. I feel like there are certain times when I just want to like sit down and read like a good book. And most of the time honestly, for me music also is a good source because you can just play a song anywhere and you can find the right mood and the right feeling for it. That's nice. Yeah. Are you like a movie person or any of those? So I prefer books over like movies and shows honestly. I feel like books have a lot more depth and a lot more wall-written development. That goes like really into vivid detail and like character building and etc. But I do enjoy movies also. Just not as much. How about you? I am not really a mood person, but movies is a good way to socialize. So if like I was like, let's go see that I'm like, let's see, I have no idea what it is as far as it's not for I'm fine. I also like to read, but it's kind of hard with academics. It's it's it's hard to balance. Yeah. But yes, I see movies as a social action. Yeah, it's it's like a cultural understanding type situation. People like reference movies and I like I have no idea what you're talking about. Yeah. Do you have a favorite music genre or like movie or book? Nice. Nice. In terms of movies, I like cinema paradiso, which is an old Italian movie. Very cute. A lot of crying involved. Yeah, it's about the story of like a young mom, which fall in love with like cinema. Because like there was a small cinema in his town. So he wanted to work for it and his mother was against it. And you can see how he developed from a kid who got through working at the cinema and through learning about cinema and page and all of that. It's it's very cute. I don't know. In terms of music, I would say that I like a lot of love music, which is like more starting music, you know, you let it get background. It goes. Yeah, I love that. Yeah, honestly, I'll start with music first. I absolutely really love that. I love like honestly, I really like non lyrical music. I love like instrumental music, like soundtracks, lo-fi. I also like like Andy Rock or like Andy Pop. Yeah, like acoustic folk music. Just like I'm pretty wide variety, honestly. And then favorite movie. So that's very difficult for me. I'll say my favorite animated movie because I know that. It's like a Japanese anime type movie and it's called Machia with the Thomas flower balloons. I don't know if you've ever heard of it. It's it's sad. It's like it's like really peaceful kind. I should say he's well, it's not peaceful though. It starts off with like a dragon tearing down like the entire population of the people. Yeah, and then like the main character is like she's like she looks like a prolonged life. She's like a part of like a different race, basically. And they're like discriminated against. Yeah. Yeah. And basically like she tries to blend into society after like these people from like the kingdom, like tried and just like basically to conquer the people. I like take them like under their control. And then she basically lives like the life of her mom because she found like a baby and then she raises him. And it's just like it's a whole journey. It's a whole journey. But I would recommend watching it on Mother's Day, honestly. And have tissues have tissues and clinics. Oh, I will be living my promise. What's your favorite book? I love this question, but I hate it so much because I love to ask it and care other people's opinions, but I hate answering it. OK. Shoot. So the thing is like my favorite genre, I would say fantasy is like down just like hands down. I love fantasy. I love fantasy so much. But I want to say my favorite book at this moment is one that I recently read. And it was called Where the Crawdads See. And it's like it's it has so much inside of it. It's I think it's fiction. But it tells us like this this girl who grew up in the swamp and she's like really, really poor and like she didn't go to score anything. She didn't really have like any socialization with other people after like her mom left and then like her father was like kind of abusive. And then like all of that's why all of her siblings left because they just like kind of deal with like her father. And then so eventually like her father also left her and she was like basically alone, just like living in the swamp. But I think like she she grew really, really close to the swamp and like it became like basically her home and like her best friend as well. And it's like at the same time, it's it's so interesting because it's like it's a nonlinear timeline. And it kind of switches around. So at the beginning, like it reveals that there's like a murder and like throughout the entire bucket, solely unravels like her story, prottologically, but also like what's happening with the murder of history. And it all connects. It's like really really good. Yeah. That's that's actually like a good book. Yeah, it is. I honestly, I think I should have a couple tears. What's your favorite book? So it's a Greek book, but it exists in translation. It's called Zurbas, if I'm a mistake, and in English, which is about like the story of like the author, or at least this is how it's portrayed in a book meeting a very, you know, like because the author represents like the person like of academia, but the person he met and they went through the journey together is more of like a feeling person of let's live the moment. So it's like it's just it's like the let's say like the adventures of those two people, but from a more a philosophical scope, it has a lot of philosophy. And it's it's very cute and nice. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's not really interesting. Yeah. Like reading a lot of like philosophical kind books. And I do like it. Actually, I have the bad behavior. Like if the book is not interested for me for like the first two hours I read it, I'm never going to finish it. It's the book needs to be like making that I want to finish it in like five days. If like if it goes more, I'm never going to read it. So it's like I don't really have a lot of books that I have really enjoyed reading. I'm more of like a shorter version books person. Oh, God. Very good. Like I read the Hangar games. That was pretty good. Like I was like, yes. I don't know. Hangar games are really we need more of a fund as a book. So it's really, you know, keeping me there being like, yes. Yeah. Yeah. No, I totally do sense that. Yeah. Yeah.\n",

      " That's going to be an interesting discussion because I'm also from a different college. So I guess our, our, you know, experience with like in person education is different. So I can start I'm from the College of the Atlantic, which is a much smaller college compared to call me. We are in total 350 students. And this year was the first year in person and I just finished my freshman year. So I literally went to college with in person classes during COVID. I personally loved it because it wasn't that different that how my college functions. We had to be masked. We have small classes. We have a lot of, you know, a trip compartment or like labs. So like I didn't really felt that I'm missing anything. And I really prefer being in person than having an online class. And that was the reason why I delayed going to college for a year. Personally, I'm very comfortable being in class during COVID. If the college takes good precautions. So we were having regular weekly testings of like 25% of the student. And not the student body, basically the body of the college every week. So I was feeling pretty safe and the higher number we ever reached with COVID cases was 1616. So it was pretty okay. I got COVID, but it didn't got it from my college. But still it was like, yeah, I, yeah, that's your opinion. Yeah, so I have quite a different experience because I actually wasn't in college at that time. I'm a freshman right now. So I was actually in high school. And my high school is actually like larger and more students than Colby. So there is like about 3000 students. And there's like 30 to 40 students per class. And like we, I think like our district, our like county is like one of the top five largest districts like in the United States. So when COVID like started and like, and like around March, the school decided to just like close down. Like basically stop like squat tivities. Last few weeks were just like masking up. And then we went to like full online mode. And honestly, it was, it was kind of rough because it was so abrupt. It just like it happened so quickly. And then like we just basically ended the year just like being online. And a lot of people just kind of just like lost contact, I guess. And then my training senior year was actually online too. There's just so many people like in class and then my high school is just like not that large at all. And like our classrooms are like pretty small and there's so many students. And so even when they started up like this hybrid program where like you can choose to come to school. There is only like maybe one or two people who chose to like actually go to school because our school had like a really weird schedule. Where like you went to school for like the first two periods, but then you would go back for lunch and then finish up like the rest of your classes online. And then like while you're in class, you have to be doing like the same thing as like the online students. So you basically just take out your laptop and then stare at a screen like you'd be doing at home anyways. So it really didn't feel like an in person education at all. It was basically like you're still doing online education, but you're just in a classroom. So that's why I think like many people just didn't think that it was worth like going to school and it takes me at 25 minutes like get to school. So it's like transportation and just like a whole whole bunch of factors and I just didn't think that it was worth it. But I think like in your situation like where there's like not that many people and it seems like you're still having like a pretty good experience like a normal for average like relatively normal college experience like I think that would be pretty enjoyable. Yeah. Like basically like my college was this year. But I knew that even before they weren't really having in their sunglasses it was more hybrid and that other people were very satisfied but I like drink all of it I was fully quarantining. I was growing up here and I helped with them back and back home. I'm from Greece. So we opened during summer for two decision and after we were quarantining for five months. Summer we opened back in for two years and since then I have been in US so like my coven experience has been either quarantining or the last year being in Poland so like my, my last year has been completely like this year has been pretty interesting. What about this year how was this year for you. I honestly I really enjoyed it. I think part of it is like because I was like online education and just like I just haven't been like socializing in person that much I like really wanted to. And like just coming to call me like it was such a relief just like being in person again and like talking to like people learning like sharing what's on us is to say like face to face and then like being able to like take notes and whatnot like in class. I really really did visit. Yeah. Oh, that's nice. Yeah. Yeah. Are there things that you have an experience because of online schooling. All right guys to interrupt we have going to switch topics right now. You have about four minutes left. So for the rest of the time, please discuss your opinions on do you think the legal drinking age should be lowered from 21 to 18. Please stay on the topic where I'm very closely related topics try to come in see each other up your opinions and I will let you know when time is up. My answer is yes, but also European. So for us it's legal to reach to the drinks is the age of 18 so it makes sense. Right. Doesn't make sense that you can drive at the age of 16 but not drink at three days of 21. You can ease your kill a person driving the drinking. But that's why I'm thinking what about you. So I actually don't have like a super strong opinion on this like. I honestly, I think that it's fine with like the drinking age being 21 as it is. I knew that most people get their licenses like around 18. I guess like maybe for like safety reasons because like teens like there's a high risk of like truck driving and then just like truck driving like housing accidents and whatnot. And like I think that that would be worth just keeping it at the age of 21. But I also know that people for 18 and who want to get drinks do not necessarily wait until they're 21 to get drinks like there are other ways that they can illegally get it anyways. But yeah, like the reason why I'm saying yes is because I feel that because you're not allowed to drink in the age of 21. And then you have the option option that actually option them. And then you have the opportunity to drink. You will really pass the boundary. I haven't really seen many factor people in my age. And then I see younger than the age limit. And I did make up here in Brazil. So I had a lot of US citizens in that program. And all of them, they basically did their gap year just to drink. They didn't took anything out of the gap here. They didn't really care about their host families or language or about the. We had actually like a apprenticeship there. They mostly care about part of the drinking because that was something that they couldn't do in US. And they wouldn't be able to do legally until the age of 21. So I do believe that having the freedom to do it, it allows you to, you know, don't pass the boundary. Don't get fucked up. Yeah, just drink one cup and know your limits. Yeah, yeah, no, that's very interesting. Yeah, that could definitely be like something to consider. Like, as you said, like, if it's like a bunch of people are like taking their gap year off just to drink. Like, I don't know if lowering the drinking age, like when people still do that. I'm honestly not sure. Like, maybe they would still like people when they turn 21, they like still have like their parties and everything like they get completely chunk. And that could also still happen when they're 18. Yeah, I guess it's kind of hard to say, like, predict people's.\n",

Personally, I'm very comfortable being in class during COVID. If the college takes good precautions. So we were having regular weekly testings of like 25% of the student. And not the student body, basically the body of the college every week. So I was feeling pretty safe and the higher number we ever reached with COVID cases was 1616. So it was pretty okay. I got COVID, but it didn't got it from my college. But still it was like, yeah, I, yeah, that's your opinion. Yeah, so I have quite a different experience because I actually wasn't in college at that time. I'm a freshman right now. So I was actually in high school. And my high school is actually like larger and more students than Colby. So there is like about 3000 students. And there's like 30 to 40 students per class. And like we, I think like our district, our like county is like one of the top five largest districts like in the United States. So when COVID like started and like, and like around March, the school decided to just like close down. Like basically stop like squat tivities. Last few weeks were just like masking up. And then we went to like full online mode. And honestly, it was, it was kind of rough because it was so abrupt. It just like it happened so quickly. And then like we just basically ended the year just like being online. And a lot of people just kind of just like lost contact, I guess. And then my training senior year was actually online too. There's just so many people like in class and then my high school is just like not that large at all. And like our classrooms are like pretty small and there's so many students. And so even when they started up like this hybrid program where like you can choose to come to school. There is only like maybe one or two people who chose to like actually go to school because our school had like a really weird schedule. Where like you went to school for like the first two periods, but then you would go back for lunch and then finish up like the rest of your classes online. And then like while you're in class, you have to be doing like the same thing as like the online students. So you basically just take out your laptop and then stare at a screen like you'd be doing at home anyways. So it really didn't feel like an in person education at all. It was basically like you're still doing online education, but you're just in a classroom. So that's why I think like many people just didn't think that it was worth like going to school and it takes me at 25 minutes like get to school. So it's like transportation and just like a whole whole bunch of factors and I just didn't think that it was worth it. But I think like in your situation like where there's like not that many people and it seems like you're still having like a pretty good experience like a normal for average like relatively normal college experience like I think that would be pretty enjoyable. Yeah. Like basically like my college was this year. But I knew that even before they weren't really having in their sunglasses it was more hybrid and that other people were very satisfied but I like drink all of it I was fully quarantining. I was growing up here and I helped with them back and back home. I'm from Greece. So we opened during summer for two decision and after we were quarantining for five months. Summer we opened back in for two years and since then I have been in US so like my coven experience has been either quarantining or the last year being in Poland so like my, my last year has been completely like this year has been pretty interesting. What about this year how was this year for you. I honestly I really enjoyed it. I think part of it is like because I was like online education and just like I just haven't been like socializing in person that much I like really wanted to. And like just coming to call me like it was such a relief just like being in person again and like talking to like people learning like sharing what's on us is to say like face to face and then like being able to like take notes and whatnot like in class. I really really did visit. Yeah. Oh, that's nice. Yeah. Yeah. Are there things that you have an experience because of online schooling. All right guys to interrupt we have going to switch topics right now. You have about four minutes left. So for the rest of the time, please discuss your opinions on do you think the legal drinking age should be lowered from 21 to 18. Please stay on the topic where I'm very closely related topics try to come in see each other up your opinions and I will let you know when time is up. My answer is yes, but also European. So for us it's legal to reach to the drinks is the age of 18 so it makes sense. Right. Doesn't make sense that you can drive at the age of 16 but not drink at three days of 21. You can ease your kill a person driving the drinking. But that's why I'm thinking what about you. So I actually don't have like a super strong opinion on this like. I honestly, I think that it's fine with like the drinking age being 21 as it is. I knew that most people get their licenses like around 18. I guess like maybe for like safety reasons because like teens like there's a high risk of like truck driving and then just like truck driving like housing accidents and whatnot. And like I think that that would be worth just keeping it at the age of 21. But I also know that people for 18 and who want to get drinks do not necessarily wait until they're 21 to get drinks like there are other ways that they can illegally get it anyways. But yeah, like the reason why I'm saying yes is because I feel that because you're not allowed to drink in the age of 21. And then you have the option option that actually option them. And then you have the opportunity to drink. You will really pass the boundary. I haven't really seen many factor people in my age. And then I see younger than the age limit. And I did make up here in Brazil. So I had a lot of US citizens in that program. And all of them, they basically did their gap year just to drink. They didn't took anything out of the gap here. They didn't really care about their host families or language or about the. We had actually like a apprenticeship there. They mostly care about part of the drinking because that was something that they couldn't do in US. And they wouldn't be able to do legally until the age of 21. So I do believe that having the freedom to do it, it allows you to, you know, don't pass the boundary. Don't get fucked up. Yeah, just drink one cup and know your limits. Yeah, yeah, no, that's very interesting. Yeah, that could definitely be like something to consider. Like, as you said, like, if it's like a bunch of people are like taking their gap year off just to drink. Like, I don't know if lowering the drinking age, like when people still do that. I'm honestly not sure. Like, maybe they would still like people when they turn 21, they like still have like their parties and everything like they get completely chunk. And that could also still happen when they're 18. Yeah, I guess it's kind of hard to say, like, predict people's.\n",

      " So, like, what's your favorite book or like movie? Um, so I don't, I haven't read an actual story or like a book book in a while. Um, but recently I've read like the alchemist. I don't know if you've heard of it. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, what do you think of it? I haven't finished it yet. I'm still like in the middle of, but. I mean, I think I read it a few years ago. So, like, I don't remember every detail, but I remember that like it was philosophical. And like, I, I'm like found some coast that like resonated. Um, I remember that I took some notes from that book, like from a, like, from a not from my personal book. I mean, um, so like life lessons kind of thing. Okay. That's cool. That's dope. Um, yeah. Um, it seems very philosophical. I mean, I've, I got it from old high school teacher. And he said that in the mail. So it was very nice to see that. Um, but yeah, I'm not. Don't really read as many books. I do watch a lot of movies and TV shows. Um, what movies are you into? Um, like my, my favorite movie is Harry Potter. Like I really like Harry Potter. And I read the read the books when I was a child, but like, you know, watching the movies and I like when I got bored or just like, when I felt like I want to watch it again. Um, so like, it's my favorite from also I didn't like a lot of the musical. Um, the what? Do you know that's? I'm not too sure. I know that I know definitely know how you feel about Harry Potter. Sure. Um, because similar to me, I like also read the books that Harry Potter like third, fourth grade and then I'm watching the movies, getting a Lego set for them for my birthday. Like, um, it was, I enjoy Harry Potter a lot. And it's always like, um, like you said, it's like the field and movie. If you want to watch it in your free time or something, you just put it on and start watching it. Um, yeah, I guess like similar Harry Potter, like there's those big blockbuster cash money movies like. Um, the Marvels Avengers and then Star Wars and then a bunch of Disney movies like. Um, I know I always watched Reddit, to me. Or over the hedge robots. A monster zinc, like, incredible. All these kind of good movies that. It's good entertainment all the time. Also, I like shake and I say. Mm hmm. Shrek and I say you're really good ones too. Um, it's weird saying that when you're older too. It's like you see a lot of jokes that you didn't realize were in them, especially Shrek. Yes. Wow. Thanks. I don't like social jokes as well. So like, and like when I watched the child, I can catch them. And I watched it again. Here I go. Like, I was like, Oh, okay. Yeah. Wow. It's not as innocent as I thought. I mean, I feel the same way with, um, music. Because when music is like, like, I don't know growing up, I listen to a lot of people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He was always on the radio. And I was like, wow, that's what it's actually about. I thought he was just wanting to have a good time, but. Right. The hotel room is different. So, you know, it's like. Different meetings start to realize it, but. Still entertaining just as it was. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you watch a lot of TV shows along with movies? Um, I, I watched a, how I met her mother. I was like, um, Bridget and the queen scambit. Okay. Yeah. What about you? Uh, I feel like my TV shows are very on the opposite side, where I watched like the boys. I don't know if you've heard of it. The Amazon. It's very like graphic superhero, bad guy kind of thing. Um, So I wouldn't recommend it if you don't like too much of just everything over stimulation. But, um, it's fun. Uh, what else do I like? I watch, um, a lot of like Japanese shows like anime and stuff too. Um, and just like. Just like a bunch of international TV shows too, because different, it's fun to see like different cultures. And what they have, what's their mainstream media. So that's interesting to me too. I think I haven't like, I think I haven't watched on anime before. Like I, I usually watch what I find on Netflix and like. I just, I think I don't like. Try to find any other source much like, like you do with like international TV shows. Mm hmm. I think it's, I mean, I was growing up with like, you're looking at one area and Netflix, but then you start to branch out and you see like differences of what cultures find as normal entertainment versus like what. On the Western civilization, you find the normal entertainment. So. Um, it's very cool to see. Um, I know a lot of hype has been around like, I don't know if you heard attack on Titan. But it's like another anime that's like massive right now. So it's very, I would recommend that one. But that's also very, can be very graphic too. So I don't know. Yeah, I feel like my, my sense of media is really one side. Like, like the races and the TV shows and like the storyline. Like since I'm just like using one broadcast, like I'm, I'm just watching from Netflix most of the time. Like there, there's a lot of similarities among them. So like, you do find it as a, like, do you want to like branch out or is your fine with what it is or actually, I would like to like reach out, but like, during the school time, it's hard to do that. It's just easier to open Netflix and like, it's my comfort zone. Like, yeah, just like, I'm just, I don't know. It's easier to do that other than just trying to find other, any other shows because I always have hard time finding it. Like, for example, if I wanted to watch a movie, I sometimes spend a couple of minutes or sometimes half an hour to just like try to find the movie that I'm on the watch. So instead of that, like, I, I'm continuing the show that I'm already having been watching. It's easier. Yeah, I definitely feel that we start looking for a movie at 630. We don't find a way to attend 30. Like, it's always that case. You just want to switch, put Swear at their time. And the end is only no movie that playing. But yeah, I definitely agree. A lot of times it's very hard to watch something during like school and when stuff picks up. So, I guess like another term entertainment would be like music. You know, it's not music because that's like something you can do while you're doing schoolwork. Actually, like, I can't listen to music while I'm studying. It just distracts. But like, I, I like listening to music music. For example, while I'm trying my hair or like, or like while I'm cleaning my room. Like, and I think I mostly listen to pop music. I also like listening to Beyonce, Keira, like some songs. Yeah. I realize that like when I listen to some soul songs, I feel also a little bit down. So like when I want to listen to music, I just try to hype myself up by like, it's a, like, energetic songs. What about you? I kind of listen to like everything all over. I'm doing homework. I listen to more like R&B, like chill. When I'm with like people outside, I'll listen to like pop, pop music rep. And then you got your dance like Latina. And hop. And then like Afro beat sometimes. And so. And then like this weekend we went to the Diwali celebration and we listened to Indian music. Like Bollywood music. So it's kind of all over the place. So I guess it's just very dependent on what I'm doing and what my mood is. Yeah. But I guess I feel like sentiment when you said like you can't figure out music to like listen to when you're studying. That's a very hard thing to figure out. But, um, yeah, I think for me, it's just like the chill more relaxed music is what I can listen to as in background noise. So I'm doing the work. Actually, like, it's easier to focus on my work when I, and listen to the music at the same time while I'm doing math or like. Something stem related, but like, for example, if I'm writing a paper that's almost impossible for me to just like focus on the paper and listening and listen to the music at the same time. That's a good. As well. Yeah. That's fair. Because I think with the lyrics involved while you're writing, it's like over simulation, but math is numbers and. X plus Y plus Z, you know, so you can listen to music and do that.\n",

Like since I'm just like using one broadcast, like I'm just watching from Netflix most of the time. Like there, there's a lot of similarities among them. So like, you do find it as a like, do you want to like branch out or is it just, you're fine with what it is or? Actually, I would like to like reach out, but like during the school time, it's hard to do that. It's just easier to open Netflix and like, it's my comfort zone. Like, yeah, just like, I'm just, I don't know. It's easier to do that other than just trying to find other, any other shows because I always have hard time finding it. Like, for example, if I wanted to watch a movie, I sometimes spend a couple of minutes or sometimes half an hour to just like try to find the movie that I'm on the watch. So instead of that, like I'm applying some continuing the show that I'm already having watching. It's easier. Yeah. I definitely feel that we start looking for a movie at six 30. We don't find a way to attend 30. Like it's always that case. Like you just want to switch, put Swear at their time and me and there's only no movie that playing. But yeah, I definitely agree. A lot of times it's very hard to watch something during like school and when stuff kicks out. So I guess like another term of entertainment would be like music. It's not music because that's like something you can do while you're doing schoolwork. Actually, like I can't listen to music while I'm studying. It just affects. But like I like listening to music. For example, while I'm trying my hair or like, or like while I'm cleaning my room. Like. And I think I mostly listen to pop music. I also like listening to Beyonce, Kigga, like some songs. Yeah. I realize that like when I listen to some songs, I feel also a little bit down. So like when I want to listen to music, I just try to hype myself up by like, it's a more energetic songs. What about you? I kind of listen to like everything all over. I'm doing homework. I listen to more like R&B like chill. When I'm with like people outside, I'll listen to like pop, pop music rep. And then you got your dance like. Latina. And hop. And then like Afro beat sometimes. And so. And then like this weekend, we went to the Dibali celebration and we listened to Indian music. It's kind of all over the place. So I guess it's just very dependent on what I'm doing and what my mood is. Yeah. But I guess I feel it sentimentally said like you can't figure out music to like listen to when you're studying. That's a very hard thing to figure out. But yeah, I think for me, it's just like the chill more relaxed music is what I can listen to as in background. You only saw him doing the work. Actually, like, it's easier to focus on my work when I and listen to the music at the same time while I'm doing math or like something stem related. But like, for example, if I'm writing a paper that's almost impossible for me to just like focus on the paper and listening and listen to the music at the same time. That's a good. As well. Yeah, that's fair. Because I think with the lyrics involved while you're writing, it's like over simulation, but math is numbers and X plus Y plus Z, you know, so you can listen to music and do that. Yeah.\n",

      " What do you think? So 21, I think it should stay on 21 considering the dumb amount of damage alcohol has on many people and also the brain development stages. So like the brain starts to, at least I think it's in women, it develops from some age, like 15 or something to 18 and then for guys it fully develops after 20 or 21. And so I think it's important for the development process to occur to a certain extent before people are legally allowed to drink. And I say that, but people are obviously drinking under age too so that's not like, necessarily stops but it definitely implies that there's a certain amount of time that you have to give for your brain to fully develop before you should start drinking. And so that's why I think 21 is an ideal age for people to start. And I also think that at 21 you're like, oh, I'm an adult, like you feel more an adult you have more responsibility. Most people are out of their moms and dads basement. So it's like, you have to be more assertive your decisions, especially when it comes to drinking so I think the opposite, like I think it should like, it should be 18 because people like, especially at colleges like their students have, you know, like drink all the time, especially at the weekends. So, but since they are not used to drinking. They just like some of them just start drinking when they get to college. So they sometimes get crazy about it, like, and just like because it's something that is new to them. So I think it's better just lower down the age and I think like, if it's legal maybe since if that's some, something is forbidden. And sometimes want to do it more. So also like I'm from Turkey, and in Turkey, the legal age of like drinking is 18. And I think, I don't know. Talk about biological aspect of it much. So you are right about the development mental process. It seems like people just don't, people are not aware of that already so I don't know how that would affect their decision of like drinking or not because like people are obviously, also aware of it. And most of them. So like, probably even like they know about it's probably they will continue drinking it, especially at especially college kids. Yeah, I do agree. I think regardless of whether you change it to 18 or 21. You're so gonna get the same group of people drinking. It's like not gonna change from it to change like, and I do agree with the sentiment where it's like when it's forbidden. People aspire to it, whether it's like breaking a lot like running a red light. Well, you do rental red light crazy. Being that kind of bad boy or breaking the rules kind of thing. And I was gonna ask like because Turkey obviously has like 18 and much of Europe really has like 16 or something that. And so there's a very loose. I guess law or retaliation against under a drinking in Europe and many other countries. I'm asking like if you drink under 18 or. I can. Oh, you can hear. Okay. I would say because in Europe, like a lot of people do drink under 18 right it's like 16 is usually where people start to get into like bars and clubs and people don't really stress the law as much. But I guess in America or something you would see like everyone's very strict on the 21 limit. I guess you're right in the sense that if you grow up with it or like start drinking at early age, it will. Like help you grow accustomed to it so you won't go overboard. But then there's also the cases where people start drinking heavy at 18 and then in 18 is a pretty, pretty like important age, especially coming into college and making a lot of bad decisions in high school. And so I think that's a good question to college can definitely like, call it your career or like hurt you developmentally and like as an independent student early on so that would just like. Negative, negatively affect you. I think most importantly, regardless of 18 to 21 it just you have a good influence where it comes to drinking the goods surrounding people friends. Like where you want how to pace and take your time. But yeah, I guess you have a different view on it because you are from a place where 18 is the limit so. Actually, you are right but for example in Turkey, it's actually like for example if you're under 18 you can't go into a club or a bar. Last varieties, or you can't buy drinks like maybe like if you're 17 or so and like if you look older people might might not ask for an idea but most of the time they ask it. So, but actually like after 18 since you can like going to a club easily. I agree that it's a little bit early to like expose yourself into that lifestyle. Like 18 is a, I mean, it is a young age. So it's better to maybe like, drink in your room or like with your, with a couple of couple of friends that you already know other than just like go to a club and drink with people you don't know. So yeah. So Turkey's has a lot of like Muslim population right so that definitely affects the drinking situation versus like other European countries, or 16 or 15 or something but Turkey and many other countries around are like, heavily mostly Muslim populated so that definitely probably affects it right. Actually like it depends. For example in Istanbul. Yes, there are like many Muslim people because like it's Turkey, Turkey's a Muslim country I mean, but especially in Istanbul like there are many people who are like really into going to nightclubs. And like there are also many non Muslim Muslim people living in especially in Istanbul because it's a very crowded and common put in city. So, yeah, maybe like some cities that affect its effects the condition but like most of the bars and nightclubs are also in big cities. So, and in big cities like there are also non Muslim people are like Muslim but not really religious people who are Muslim but who also like drinks. Yeah. So it's not like, I think it's, it's not a big factor. I mean, okay. Okay, I mean, I'm just curious, but. Yeah. Yeah. I think regardless of when it changes I think the same group of people will still like, like if you implement a rule now I don't think that the people who are doing ahead of time are going to change their mind or anything. So yeah, I think the same people would drink. I'll have the same sort of feel and sentiment on the college life and people in America. Yeah. That's all I have to say I guess I have opinions out but I guess there's interesting going in here, differing opinions. Yes. Are you from the US by the way. Yeah, so I'm from the US my parents are from India. So this is definitely a culturally different situation there too. So that's why I was wondering how it is in Turkey as well. So what's the like the age of drinking in India. I think it's 21. Oh, I'm sure but I know there's not a big heavy drinking culture. Obviously India has like, I think India has like the number one or number two and the most amount of Muslim population in the world. But again there's also been a lot of Hindus and culture is like, not as much drinking heavy too. So, yeah. Very different from the Western society.\n",

Just to clarify, it's not three items. It's as many items you can fit in a shoe box. As many as you can fit in a shoe box. Okay. So a phone. Yes, it's small, too. So like we can definitely fit into the. Like multi purpose like it has a flashlight or also flashlight would be helpful to. Probably like a knife. Like to charge the phone. You need something at some point. Like affordable or one of those solar powered. Battery. Things. I'm assuming they'll have like a lot of food on the island. Like natural food. A lot. I mean, the phone, depending on where the island is, you might get serviced or night not. So. Walk you talky. Like a radio or something. Like a small handheld radio. Like a flare gun, maybe. Yes. Yeah. Also like something to be maybe a knife or like. Yeah, like a pocket knife or something. Uh huh. Like there's a watch on the phone usually. So I don't think anything like that. I'm trying to think to all like the movies I've seen of islands. Because probably. Some sort of. First aid kit. Yeah. Like bandages. Alcoholic wipes disinfectant and all that kind of stuff. Um. Um. What do you think about clothing? Would you. Like, you know, the ones you can just like. You can just. A small raincoat. Like just. Something like travel. You can just pack them in. Yeah. Or like. Like active wear. Dry suits. Um, like probably some. Shoes that are actually like. Usable, like not. I don't know. Like fancy issues, but like, you know, like. Maybe some crock or something. But like we might not be able to fit them into the. That's true. So. Um. Would you wear like the individual toe shoes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe like purse sunglasses. That's just like a accessory that it's not really needed. No. Yeah. Like we don't know the eye. The conditions of the item. So like. It is true. I think I like putting accessories as a little bit. Actually. Mm-hmm. Um, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe like purse sunglasses. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. That's a good point. We don't know the condition. So like a jacket or raincoat. Um, shorts and pants. Um, I guess sleeping bag. I guess sleeping bags. Not going to fit. But like a blanket sort of thing. Like one of those. Like small blankets that can like expand. Uh, Like a flint, maybe a flint to start a fire. Yeah. Also like maybe a water bottle. Um, like the other ones. Uh, but like they're flat and then I knew like feel some water to them. Like they just expand. There's the plastic bag ones. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Um, Do some of those in like maybe like the one that has a purifying technique. You know, Purifying straws or whatever. Um, Maybe like some. Energy bars or energy like. Because depending on where you how long it be stranded. Also medicine. We talked about first the first eight kids, but like some painkillers or like some. Yeah. Painkillers. Um, Maybe fishing line. Because assuming it's an island, they'll have like some sort of. Fish. And so you use a fishing line fishing hook. Not too big items. Like it's very small. So you can fit them. And. Um, Yeah. So you can fit. So you can fit them. And I'm. Um, I'm just trying to island. Well, so can you fit. So I'm assuming the goal is to get off this island at some point. Yeah. Would you take anything? I know we sort of flare gun in a phone. You take anything else to like. Get off the island. I don't know. But we also like included the flesh, flesh lights. So maybe. Some signals people. Yeah. Sure. Sensing. Yeah. I don't know. But we also like included the flesh. Flashlights. So. Maybe it's. Some signals. People. Yeah. Sure. Sensing. Yeah. Sure. Sensing. Like with the flarragon flashlight. Starfire with the flint. You could use. Like string. Potentially make a raft or something. I don't know. Um, like the knife as well. Yes. To use it to like. Make a tent to like sharpen the wood. Cut up leaves. Make yourself a house. I think that's a good idea. Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I feel like at this point, our shoe box is pretty full. But yeah, I guess. A raft. Like a house. How do you think you entertain yourself? I mean, if you have a phone, it's easier. But like if something happens to the phone. Maybe a small notepad and pencil might help. Okay. You can also like use it as a diary or just like keep track of the. Days. If. To the phone. I mean. I think the diary would be nice. Just keep track of what you did. Perhaps make a movie after afterwards. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. I think that's all I have. I mean. I like the idea of a diary. I think that's a little bit of a. Um. When you bring a book. Like a small book or is that like something you could probably find on your phone. You can download on your phone or something. Yeah. Um. But maybe like, you know, the travel size. Book. Maybe one of them. If you managed to innovate, you like. Into the box. Yeah. Um. I feel like bug spray would also be a good thing. That's something or sunscreen. Those are some things. Like a small travel side or something. Yeah. Also, like something that reminds this person of their home. Like this. Or emotional support. I don't know. Yeah. Like a big below. I don't know.
