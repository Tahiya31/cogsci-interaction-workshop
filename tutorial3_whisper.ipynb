    "## Whisper tutorial notebook: Transcript\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an introduction to [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper/tree/main), a tool for detecting signals and features for emotion recognition from speech audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can be used to transcribe speech of varying length.\n",
    "* It is very accurate and pretty fast.\n",
    "* It is multilingual!\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "* It outputs transcripts in ~30 second segments. So it might cut off the speaker mid-turn, mid-utterance or mid-word.\n",
    "* It does not provide phoneme or word-level time alignments. So if you need that, this is not for you (but we know of things that might work for you! Come see us!).\n",
    "* The authors of whisper say they trained on 680,000 hours of speech+text collected from the internet. However, they don't indicate which speech, from where, transcribed by whom, or with whose consent. \n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about whisper, please refer to the [github repo](https://github.com/openai/whisper/tree/main)."

Like sometimes okay, but then other times like, I don't know. I don't find it as funny as like other people find it funny. It's a joy. I do like that. I understand that. I feel like I've just watched this many times where I guess just become like my comfort show. Like at one point I found it really funny even though it's just like, it's something I can watch and I know like everything that's gonna happen. And she's so funny. Yeah, I also really like, like all those like related type shows like Parks and Rec and the Office and Brooklyn Nine Nine. I'm gonna go watch the movie. I've seen Parks and Rec. I love Parks and Rec. Personally, the Office I've seen, it's kind of, I don't know, it's okay. Like it's funny, but it's like also like, okay. I actually haven't seen Brooklyn Nine Nine. I've seen a couple of episodes here and there, but I've like never watched it fully through it. Although I know like everyone that I've talked to is like, love to cook the best show ever. But having gotten around to it. Like what movie's too much? Recently I've been into like documentaries on Netflix. I don't know, I've had a good way to pass the time. I just actually recently watched the, like Britney versus Spears about like the trials of Britney Spears. I don't know why it was just like on Netflix. Oh, this is interesting. Other than that, I usually don't watch TV or movies that often. But I feel like I tend to go to like the classics of my all time favorite is like, Forrest Gump. I love Tom Hanks and would watch any movie events. Miracle obviously, I play hockey. So I feel like that's almost every hockey player is like, go to a movie. Actually, yeah. Top Gun. Yeah. I don't know, what do I mean? Yeah, I mean, I feel like I haven't like watched movies in the wild, but my family's really big into like Marvel and all those movies. So those are like kind of some of my favorites. And it's honestly like it's, I feel like it's more just like something we would do it as a family. Like I don't even know if I actually liked them. It's just like something that was like forced. So I never watched them since I was a kid, which is really nice. But other than that, I don't know. I feel like I watched a lot of like action movies. Like, I don't know. I don't know, like mission impossible. There's like some stuff like that. Casino Royale, like for James Bond, like the casino royale is really good. It's classic. Trying to think of what it is. Yeah. It feels funny. I've like never really seen any of the Marvel movies. So like, I already always talked about them. I don't know why I've watched them. I just, I know, I do it. I gotta like watch them in like order or whatever. But exactly. It's tough. Like if you have to start watching them like 10 years ago, it's so hard to like start now. I'm feeling tired. I messed up us a little bit. Yeah. Yeah, there are also like Disney movies that like I'll watch sort of like also like. What's your favorite name and name? I really love the Incredibles. Okay. I think Embers New Groove is hilarious. Like I still laugh at it. Yeah, watch it. What about you? I also like Embers New Groove. That's a good one. I like Toy Story. I honestly like all of them. Toy Story. Toy Story is not Disney is it? Isn't it Pixar? Oh, it's Pixar. Yeah, you're right. I do it live. Unpopular, Disney and I still think Frozen is better than Moana. You think what's better than Moana? Frozen? Frozen? Yeah. Okay. I can say I'm green, but I do enjoy both movies. So understandable. It was really good. Yeah, I really like Moana. I'm gonna say that a bit more. But I honestly really like Frozen too. What's the question? Wait, what's the question? Just based off like movies and TV shows that all aspects of entertainment. You don't remember? I think it was all entertainment. Okay. Do you have any particular interests in music? Yeah, I really like Maggie Rogers. Okay. Those are like my big two. I also really like this band called The Backstreet Lovers. But they don't have blossoms. Who are you? I'm kind of in the, I guess, yeah, I'm the same. I really like Matt Mason. I don't know, Mumford and Sons, obviously. Oh, I love Mumford and Sons. Yeah. So I guess like that, but it's pretty much. I think I listened to like a good variety. Yeah, I agree. I feel like I mostly listened to like either indie or like alternative, but then like, I don't know. I feel like some pop will like sneak into there. Like, I do really like Harry Styles and stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah. Do you watch any sports? Yeah. I mean, I obviously enjoy watching hockey. I feel like I watch that the most. Um, I also enjoy watching field hockey because I played it as well, but I don't watch it as much. I love watching the Olympics, literally any part of the Olympics, summer or winter. I think every event is like so entertaining. Um, yeah, who are you? Yeah, I also love the Olympics. I love watching gymnastics and like track and field and like swimming. I would say the big things that I watch in Olympics. Um, I watch like football and baseball occasionally, but I'm not like I want to consistently. Um, but yeah, I would say the biggest sports watching is during the Olympics. Yeah, I also watch football and baseball, but yeah, like I said, not religiously. I don't follow any team specifically. So I'm not one of those like religious. Ah, I got to down her Sunday night football or whatever. Yeah. Same. It's not just like if it's on a watch and pay attention. Yeah. If other people are really into it, then I'll be like, okay. Yeah. I don't know what else to talk about. Okay. Um, you guys can also talk about books. Oh, books. Okay. Thank you. Um, I don't read that much. I read a lot outside of school recently. Um, one of my favorite books that I read a really long time ago was the bookies. Okay. Yeah. That was a really good book. Um, I don't know, like growing up, I read all the Harry Potter books, of course. Um, yeah, I'm terrible. I never. I don't know. That's okay. That's okay. Um, yeah, I also read like Percy Jackson and like those kind of books too. I was growing up. Yeah, I didn't read Percy Jackson. I feel like I really missed out on like the whole book thing as a child. I was never really like forced to read, I guess, or enjoyed reading. So I just never read. Um, really, I think I read that like everybody else read. It's like the magic tree house. And then after that, I just, I don't even remember my favorite type of book. I feel like it's been so long since I really enjoyed reading a book. Yeah. Tom, sorry, I got to cut it in here. Um, you guys, this time is up before you have your next conversation. You will just need to answer a few questions. So please move back to the computer, navigate back to the survey and answer the three questions.

      " Okay, so for today's study, you'll be having a couple of conversations about different topics, and I'll give you the topic for each conversation right before you start. Please try to stay on topic on very closely related topics while you're talking. Okay, let's get started with the first conversation. The next 10 minutes. I mean, I personally think that they should be allowed to vote. My biggest reason behind that would be that. Like, people could have very minor things on their criminal record and still not be allowed to vote and I don't think that's okay, or they can be wrong. They can do something and then not be allowed to vote for the rest of their life. And I feel like that's not right, especially since there can't be like 100% certain with any criminal trial that a person actually did their or they just not allowed to vote while in jail or prison or that like, is it taken on for their whole life? I think that's a good point. I do kind of see voting as a privilege that can be taken away. So I can kind of see where like kind of is borderline like, oh, maybe, you know, you did something bad therefore it's party or punishment, you can't vote or whatever in the next section, but I do understand that, you know, you as a citizen, you have the right to vote. So like, it's kind of also very important. So I don't know. I don't really, I was strong opinion either way, I guess. No, I agree. And I guess I wasn't thinking of like when they were in jail. I guess I kind of, to even consider them like they could be allowed to vote even while in jail. I feel like while you're institutionalized, you're kind of like separated from the outside world and politics anyways. So I guess I also really want to strongly note whether they should be able to vote while institutionalized because like, to a certain degree, what, what their people are voting on doesn't really apply to them while they're institutionalized because they're sort of living under the laws of the institution instead. But yeah, like I, I agree. I feel like it does depend on the severity of like what you were, what you're in jail for like if it's a marijuana offense like I feel like there's no reason why we should, we should be able to vote for the rest of your life, but you know, if it was like a more serious murder charge then I feel like I do agree that voting is a privilege that me and that key should be taken away. Yeah, I agree the severity of the keys is kind of a very different. So like, how do you monitor that? I think too, like you were talking about that like it doesn't really apply to them, considering that they are being, you know, under an institution rather than in the society that they're voting for, like how informed would they be voting just because I know not personally, but that the fact that there are limited policies while in this institution so like are they able to like understand fully what each candidate is, you know, presenting going for or is it just like they're disvoting for a name that they don't really know what the policies are behind. I mean, I guess like to counter even like my own point because I would say very similar things that like a part of me is also like well, there are a lot of people who are institutionalized and still vote and have literally no idea what's going on. So I feel like that's also something to consider. But I feel like maybe the exception to like, well, your institutionalized is like if there any laws pertaining to like criminal justice, maybe they should be allowed to vote on those particular laws because that's something that's very vested in person. And like since they're the people who are actually experiencing it like they have more like information on it that anyone else would. Yeah, that's actually a really good point. I didn't think about it. It's like what you're actually voting for like that's kind of very a broad question. So like you're right, it could be voting for like a politician but it could also be voting for certain like causes or stances to be revised or new rules so like that totally makes a lot of sense. I guess like going off about like another thing you don't have to think about is like if like it's an election and by the time they get out like they would be like if it's for president for example and like by the time they're out and on parole like it would be an administration like should they be able to vote like for president while they're institutionalized because like they're going to be released like by the time they begin stuff like that. I don't really have an exact answer from that but I just feel like that's another thing to consider. It's like the timeline of when they're going to be affected by the elections they're not allowed to vote in. So you guys still have about five minutes left and right now we're going to switch topics. So your new question is should people be able to video record strangers in public. You have about five minutes left. It's a really tough question, especially with like the prevalence of social media and like SACCHI and all that different kind of things because like I want to say no and that's not right but also like I know I've probably done it myself and not even realized it. I definitely think people need to be more conscious of it than they actually are. I feel like we like to videos of our friends while in public and there are lots of other people in the background and we just like don't like think about it. But yeah, I would. I guess I would lean towards you know but I feel like in practice that's actually kind of hard. I don't know. I feel like it's important for you to kind of be self aware of like how your actions may be perceived by others, especially because you usually not 100% of the time but usually what's recorded is like pretty accurate representation of what's actually going on in events. And I think that's always the case that you know I feel like there's every once in a while kind of like one of those like weird situations where what's actually going on in a video is like not what's happening. But I do think it's kind of like important for people to understand that they can't just like go willy nilly and just like not. Not behave but like do things that they wouldn't normally I guess just because they're not on camera like I don't know. Yeah, yeah I agree with you. I feel like when we do like choose to film people on public like it should be for like a specific reason like for example like they're like security cameras or for like people's protection and like are used to a lot of criminal and I think they can be very beneficial but I think we just have to be mindful when we implement them like how like how much are we filing people's privacy. And so I think that's a good idea of informed consent should really apply to like to keep like videotaping people like to keep like videotaping people like to do it. Like they always contain consent at least before or after. So I think like that's a good like the idea of informed consent should really apply to like to keep like videotaping people like do they know they're being videotaped like a security camera like to a bank like you know that you're going to be like on camera somewhere like I like it should only mean situations where people sort of know that, you know, that they're being washed essentially. So I think that's a good idea of what's going on. So I think that's a good idea of what's going on. Kind of drives the line of like what's public versus what's private. And what's deemed a public space versus what's deemed a private space. And even that can change just like socially to like you're in a private setting with a whole bunch of people like does that make it a public space for then it's okay to film someone. And then one of those things where a lot of good things have come out from the videotaping straighters I think like, especially with like the police point and being able to kind of film that and it provides more of a solid evidence versus even then you have people that like videotaped like quote unquote Karen's just to like, enrange them further to the situation and to like more destructive say. So your point about intentionality I think behind videotaping is also really key and kind of, I don't know, deciding whether it's a good thing or a bad thing. So I think that's the point with like people videotaping like essentially like Karen being crazy and it just kind of like, it doesn't really help anything like I mean holding the person accountable so if you're just like videotaping someone just so like if there's like, essentially ruin their life because like, you know, they're gonna their name is going to be somewhere like someone's going to recognize them and then like they might lose their job and stuff like that like I feel like that really harmful. So yeah, I do think like intention is really important. And thank you guys. Okay, you guys, it's time is up. So before you have the next conversation, you'll just need to answer a few questions. So please move back to the computer and navigate back to the survey and answer the three questions. Once you've done that, you can navigate back to the zoom window, and let me know as soon as you're done by just sitting back down in blue chair.\n",

      " Okay, so for today's study, you'll be having a couple of conversations about different topics, and I'll give you the topic for each conversation right before you start. Please try to stay on topic on very closely related topics while you're talking. Okay, let's get started with the first conversation. The next 10 minutes. I'll discuss your opinion on should people with criminal records be allowed to vote. Please stay on the topic or I'm very closely related topics. Try to convince each other of your opinion. I'll let you know when 10 minutes are up. I mean, I personally think that they should be allowed to vote. My biggest reason behind that would be that, like, people could have very minor things on their criminal record and still not be allowed to vote and I don't think that's okay or they can be wrong. They choose to do something and then not be allowed to vote for the rest of their life. So that's not right. Especially since there can't be like 100% certain with any criminal trial that a person actually did their case that started. I think it's very situational. I totally understand that point. I think it depends. Like, is it, are they just not allowed to vote while in jail or prison or that like, is it taken on for their whole life? I think that's a good point. I see voting as a privilege that can be taken away. So I can kind of see where like kind of is borderline like, oh, maybe, you know, you did something bad. I mean, I think that's a good point. I think it's not that important. I think it's important to party or punishment. You can't vote or whatever in the next section, but I do understand that, you know, you, as a citizen, you have the right to vote. So like, it's kind of also very important. So I don't know. I don't really have a strong opinion either way, I guess. I think it's a good point to even consider that like, they could be allowed to vote even while in jail. I feel like while you're institutionalized, you're kind of like separated from the outside world and politics anyways. So I guess I also really want to strongly do you know whether they should be able to go while institutionalized because like, to start to agree with what what their people are voting on doesn't really apply to them while they're institutionalized. Because they're sort of living under the laws of the institution instead. But yeah, like I, I agree. I feel like it does depend on severity of like what you were, what you're in jail for. Like, if it's a marijuana offense, like I feel like there's no reason why you should be able to vote for the rest of your life. But you know, if it was like a more serious murder charge than I feel like I do agree that voting is a privilege that me and that key should be taken away. Yeah, I agree the severity of the keys is kind of a very different. So like, how do you monitor that. So I think too, like you were talking about that like, it doesn't really apply to them, considering that they are being, you know, under an institution rather than in the society that they're voting for, like how informed would they be voting just because I know Right, and I really appreciate with what they are voting against a body state. And in fact, sadly, I really appreciate all those guys and you know how the bellows, you know, in multiple ways is based on people who need to get to those institutions and doing things ignorantly but that the fact that there are limited resources while in those institutions. So like are they able to like, understand fully what each candidate is presenting or going for, or is it just like I guess to counter even my own point, because I would say very similar things that a part of me is also like, well, there are a lot of people who are institutionalized and still vote and have literally no idea what's going on. So I feel like that's also something to consider. But I feel like maybe the exception to, well, you're institutionalized, it's like if there are any laws pertaining to criminal justice, maybe they should be allowed to vote on those particular laws, because that's something they do have in very vested interest in. And like, since they are the people who are actually experiencing it, like they have more like information on it than anyone else would. Yeah, that's actually a really good point. I didn't think about it. It's like what you're actually voting for. Like that's kind of a very broad question. So like you're right, it could be voting for like a politician, but it could also be voting for certain like clauses or stances to be revised or new rules. So like that totally piece of law sense. Yeah. I guess like going off of that, like another thing you don't have to think about is like if like it's an election and by the time they get out, like they would be like if it was for president, for example, and like by the time they're out and on the roll, like it would be an administration, like should they be able to vote like for president while they're institutionalized because like they're going to be released like by the time they begin stuff like that. Like I don't really have an exact answer from that, but I just feel like that's another thing to consider. It's like the timeline of when they're going to be affected by the elections they're not allowed to vote in. So you guys still have about five minutes left. And right now we're going to switch topics. So your new question is, should people be able to video record strangers in public? You have about five minutes left. I feel like that's, it's a really tough question, especially with like the prevalence of social media and like Snapchat and all that different kind of things. Cause like I want to say no and that's not right. But also like I know I've probably done it myself and not even realized it. I definitely think people need to be more conscious of that than they actually are. I feel like we like take videos of our friends while in public and there are lots of other people in the background and we just like don't really think about it. But yeah, I would, I don't know. I guess I would lean towards no, but I feel like in practice that's actually kind of hard. Yeah, I don't know. I feel like it's important for you to kind of be self aware of like how your actions may be perceived by others, especially because usually not 100% of the time, but usually what's recorded is like pretty accurate representation of what's actually going on in events. That's not always the case. I feel like there's every once in a while, kind of like one of those like weird situations where what's actually going on in a video is like not what's happening. But I do think it's kind of like important for people to understand that they can't just like go willy-nilly and just like not, no one's saying like not behave, but like do things that they wouldn't normally, I guess, just because they're not on camera, like I don't know. Yeah, yeah, I just feel like I agree with you. I feel like when we do like choose to film people on public like it should be for like a specific reason like for example, like they're like security cameras or for like people's protection and like are used in a lot of criminal trials and stuff. And I think they can be very beneficial, but I think we just have to be mindful when we implement them like how like how much are we filing people's privacy. Like another good example is like psychological studies like there are studies that video too, people like just really subserve people when they're just like in their natural environment, like in the grocery store and whatever they can have like really good insights on food behavior. But like they always contain consent at least before or after. So I think like that's a good like the idea of informed consent should really apply to like to keep like videotaping people. Like do they know they're being videotaped? Like a security camera like walking to a bank like you know that you're going to be like on camera somewhere. Like I like it should only mean situations where people sort of know that, you know, that they're being washed essentially. Kind of drive is the line of like what's public versus what's private and what's deemed a public space versus what's deemed a private space. And even that can change just like socially too. Like if you're in a private setting with a whole bunch of people like does that make it a public space for then it's okay to film someone. Yeah, I think it's kind of like one of those things where a lot of good things have come out from videotaping strangers. I think like especially with like the police point in being able to kind of film that provides more of a solid evidence versus the means that you have people that like videotape like quote unquote Karen's just to like arrange them further to the situation and to like more destructive state. So your point about intentionality I think behind videotaping is also really key and kind of, I don't know, deciding whether it's a good thing or a bad thing. No, I agree. That was like a point with like people videotaping like essentially like Karen being crazy and it just kind of like, it doesn't really help anything. Like I mean holding the person accountable is beforehand but also if you're just like videotaping someone just to like embarrass them or like essentially ruin their life because like, you know, they're gonna, their name is going to be somewhere like someone's going to recognize them and then like they might lose their job and stuff like that. Like I feel like that can be really harmful. So yeah, I do think like intention is really important. And. Thank you guys. Okay, you guys, this time is up. So before you have the next conversation you'll just need to answer a few questions. So please move back to the computer and navigate back to the survey and answer the three questions. Once you have done that, you can navigate back to the Zoom window and let me know as soon as you're done by just sitting back down in the blue chair.\n",

      " Okay, for the next 10 minutes, discuss some things you would take with you if you knew that you would be stranded on a deserted island. Let's present that you together can only take a shoebox worth of things. Try to find things that you both agree on and talk about why you should take them. By the end of the conversations, you should both agree on a list of items to put in your shoebox. I'll let you know when 10 minutes are up. She said 10 things or just like to fill a shoebox? 10 minutes. 10 minutes. But you have, yeah, just a shoebox worth of things. You can put as many things you want in the shoebox. Thank you. The first thing I was going to say was I'll bring my dog, but like I cannot finish shoebox. That would be a good thing to bring though. I don't know. I feel like it's hard to think of like small things. I don't know. Do you think of like useful things or things that are going to keep us empty things? I feel like you could need a good mixture of like both maybe. I'm also trying to do things that would fit in the shoebox. I feel like the water bottles that like it was so like pureed by the water. That would be smart. That would be smart. I feel like a knife would be really handy. Yes. Yeah. Like one of those with army knives. Yeah. All the tools. Yeah. Like matches and. Yeah. I would say a map would be helpful. But I also don't think it's like. That necessary for our survival, especially if we don't know where we are. Exactly. Yeah. I feel like if we brought like a journal. Like writing and then I mean. You have a lot of time. I feel like we explore the island. I mean, their own map, I guess. Yeah. Probably. Some type of maybe. I don't know. Food, I guess. For me, like the initial like first couple days. Like, I know I agree. At least like, I don't know materials for getting food, like. Be or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would say like books that you really like to. I mean, I think that's the only thing that can do entertain though. Okay. Loki sunscreen sunscreen. That's a good. I feel like once you get sunburned, especially if you're on the island in the sun all day. It's just miserable and probably. Bug spray. Yes. I agree with that. Flashlight. Flashlight. And. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe like a. Maybe like a flare gun or something. Oh, that's really smart. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe like. I don't know. Like paint brushes and stuff like like art supplies. Maybe I thought it would be a good way to pass this time. Yeah. Even like, if it was just like photos of like. loved ones. Oh, yeah. That's really smart. You're like, you're like, keypope or whatever. Yeah. That's really smart. I'm sure it's really. I feel like that's a pretty good blast. I know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like I really want like. It's like digits. Like the, like the little blocks or like the beats or just like something to like play with. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Really. I don't know. Like a maybe like a little first aid getters. So I'm like. Now I'm a little smart. Yeah. Disinfect or whatever. And then like. Yeah. Like a friend for like bandages or something. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like a radio for like music or like a radio. Like. Communicate with people. I mean. I mean, I guess. For both. Ideal. Music would be nice. Okay. I feel like it also depends on like what's on this. Island. Exactly. It was. Or like. Did people live there at one point or. Yeah. I feel like. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we can kind of be on our own. I really share how like. Radio frequencies work on deserted islands, but. Music. The deaf and the nights. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I feel confident that we would survive. It's materials that we bring an ocean box. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You definitely need things that like. Ostotime. Like a ball. Maybe like a mini calendar to. So now I'm going to see them. Yeah. Okay. Okay. You guys time is up. Before you have your next conversation. Oh, wait. Okay. Yeah. Sorry. Okay. You guys time is up. Please go back to computer. You'll answer one last set of questions. Once you're done, put your mask back on and come to the door. I will then tell you a little bit more about the study and what we expect to find before I let you go.\n",

      " I just wanted to listen to, um, one of my favorite artists is Taylor Swift. Um, so like, usually I just, like, that's my go-to. And I also listened to like Harry Styles and the Lumineers, um, stuff like that. Not really much like country or rap or anything. Anyway. Um, I honestly like, like a lot of genres. Um, I do like Taylor Swift. I don't listen to her often, but I guess that can just not be in common. Um, but I also like, um, I like Drake and, um, I really like, I wish. Yeah. I just really like popular stuff. I feel like I don't really go out of my way to listen to them all the time, but I like their stuff. Yeah. Um, kind of like movies to usually watch. Um, I'm a big hair part. So I watch them. Yeah. Um, I have a lot of stuff for a while, but that was like a huge part of my childhood. Yeah. I still like them. But I also like, like, um, January's movies like John Good and all of a sudden. Yeah. Um, yeah. Um, yeah. Well, actually I did rewatch the first Harry Potter movie in the fall with my roommate, which is nice. We like set like a little projector. Um, because I don't know if they put fall one kind of gives or the first one gives like fall vibes. And we just decided to watch that, but I haven't really watched them since I was a kid. My, um, brother used to read me all the books before going to bed at night. So I feel like that was a big part of why like Harry Potter so much. But yeah, I haven't watched them recently. They're really long. Yeah. Yeah. I know. I never ended up reading them myself because my brother would do like all the voices and everything and it just like what was never the same. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All of them. When I was younger, right now I don't have time to. Yeah. Definitely. Yeah. I want to. I'm just like, so it's kind of like something that's just like, it's like annoying for me to do like I have to really like the book or like really have time to do it. But like otherwise I just don't really read much. Yeah, I definitely feel like when I was very sweet. We're now really text books. Yeah. I feel like school is kind of made reading a chore and then like now I see it as like just another task after do and then I don't actually end up like picking up free read books. Do you play like any sport. Um, I don't, I'm on like a team or anything, but I used to play a lot of basketball and high school. Um, and tennis and. Um, I like work out like a lot, just an AC and stuff, but I'm not on like a team. I used to play tennis. Oh, really? Yeah. It's fine. I miss tennis. That's, I feel like that's probably my biggest hobby like or entertainment or whatever. Um, I guess it's not really entertainment, but that's what I would do in my free time is like, like go to the gym or something. Or actually, honestly, like tick talk, I think would be probably my biggest entertainment. I'm always on tick talk if I have like a spare moment. I had to delete it. It's too addicting. It's so addicting. Time passes by. You're just scrolling and I just. My, like, I think it's like something with like the, my attention span, like something about like having such short videos to watch. Like I just like get like addicted to watching them and I can't stop. Like when I'm watching a TV show, I always have to be like doing something else. Or like I won't really pay attention or like, I'll just get bored of it. So. Tick tock's like perfect because it's like always like grabbing my attention. Like, since yeah, like it's short videos. Yeah. Really focused focus. Yeah, like caters to your, like, I don't know, like the algorithm or whatever, like, they like show you what videos I think you're going to like. And it's like, it's kind of creepy, but then I just like, I don't know, end up getting sucked down like deeper into watching them. I don't really watch much TV. Like, I don't think I've watched TV or movies at all. At school since like watching Harry Potter in the fall. I think that's like the first thing I've watched. Yeah, like everyone watched you for ya and like. Um, Brigitte just came out. All my friends are talking about that. And I just not like. What? Like, same. I don't have been watched like the trendy shows. Yeah. I should be like, everybody's talking about them. Like, oh, they should be good. Yeah. I know everyone's talking about them. And I'm just like sitting there like, I don't know what you're talking about, but. There's like a party last night, those euphoria themed and I was like, I don't even know like what that would be, but. Like, everyone just wore glitter. I was like, okay. I do like like criminal lines a lot or like the doctor and stuff like that. I don't know. Cause I like to like. When I watch a show, like I want to be obviously not real, but like, I like to think about things that happen in the world. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I really like documentaries. I don't know if that's kind of. Random, but. Like, I don't know. I'm like Netflix. I'm like looking through to find something like. Like usually documentaries will like grab my eye, like you're like murder documentaries or like. I don't know. There's one about like an octopus in the sky who like would go and visit every day. Like that was super interesting to me. I feel like those like things like I'm like learning from like I just find that so entertaining. Yeah. Interesting. I feel like some definitely like this is a weird show, but have you ever watched like live below zero. What is it? I don't know. Live below zero. It's like people have it like in like really cold areas in Alaska. It's like how they survive and so I'm especially interested in. Yeah, that sounds really interesting. I've never heard of it, but that's really cool. I also like I guess this is entertainment. I really like musicals. Like I was never really a theater kid. Like I never did play or anything, but like I love or I never did. Yeah, like I was never in the plays, but I love like listening to like Hamilton like. I don't even know hairspray. Like all those like musicals just like I find them so fun. Like I guess I listen to the music more than I watch them, but I also like enjoy watching them or watching things with music in them. Yeah. I mean like I have a lot of shows for me. Yeah, like music is usually good. Yeah. Like into the woods. I think it's another. Oh, yeah. It's a good one. Yeah. Oh, and do you have an answer? I saw that one like in. What's not in person. I don't know what it's called. Like I saw that on Broadway. Yeah. And Hamilton and I saw Wicked when I was younger, but sure. I'll like I still listen to the music all the time. I love those. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I read stuff and you're like I just write about like. Like what I like acquired from that reading. It's kind of like that. That's cool. I don't read at all. I don't think like I had. Yeah, never. I even like pick the classes where I don't really have to write as much. Just not really my thing. More like math science oriented and then like writing. Just. I don't know. Never came down to me. I think math and science. I think. I think. I think. You watch like any. Watch. Watch. What? I think I'm going to be. I think I'm going to be a little bit more. Marvel. I've seen like a good amount of them just because like. I don't know. There's so many there always coming out and people are watching them but like. I wouldn't say I'm like a huge like Marvel fan. Like I've seen all of them. Like I wanted to see Spider-Man when I just came out but I didn't end up seeing it. But I do enjoy those. Yeah. I'm so sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry guys. Yeah. I've seen like a good amount of them but they're not like something I always watch. Oh yeah. I haven't. I asked because you say people watch them a lot. I could watch you but not with really. I haven't watched Spider-Man. I should. Yeah. Yeah. I saw like. One of the earlier ones like homecoming or something. And I really enjoyed that one. I like Tom Holland as Spider-Man. Yeah. I mean I just loved them as a couple in real life so much. So like I kind of really wanted to see the recent one but didn't end up getting around to it. My parents are like. Super like strict on. COVID like going out and stuff and they just don't think like movie theaters are worth it. Even though like me and my brothers were like, oh there's no one in the theater. But like my parents really still like, no, like someone might show up. Or something it's not worth risking it. So I haven't really been out to like movie theaters and stuff. Which is weird. I wonder if like COVID's definitely going to like. Make them lose a lot of business. Everything's online now. In the beginning, I feel like when COVID hit, a lot of videos. You know, I used to like the Aimsies, which is like the New Year's. They were all closing. Yeah, they closed those down.\n",

I could watch you, but not with you. I haven't watched Spider-Man. I should because of me as an artist. Yeah, yeah, I saw like one of the earlier ones, like homecoming or something.

Like in the beginning, I feel like when COVID hit, a lot of the videos, you know, are used to like the Aimsies, which is like the new theaters where I live. Like they were all closed. Yeah. Yeah, they closed those down.\n",

      " Okay, let's get started with the last conversation for the next 10 minutes. Discuss your opinions on whether you think the legal drinking age in the US should be lowered from 21 to 18 years old. Please stay on topic around very closely related topics. Try to convince each other of your opinion. I'll let you know when 10 minutes are up. Do you have a face? Sure. I do think it should be 18 just because of like there's a lot of other things at 18 that you're able to do that like go to war, for example, like if you can go to war you should be able to like go to a bar and have a drink. And I feel like there's like a lot of other like reasonings like that. Like if you can do like all these things at 18, why wouldn't you be able to like also drink like I feel like 21 is kind of just like a random age that they put. And like I forget what it is, but like when they changed like the drinking age apparently it was like by state it's like the drinking age, whatever the president was said like that state wouldn't get certain things if you didn't have the drinking age is 21. I forget what it actually was, but I heard someone like argued out of a underage drinking violation by like using that reasoning. And I thought it was super interesting that like the country was literally like blackmailed to like make the drinking age 21. So that was interesting. I don't really know the history of it, but I don't know. I feel like mixed things, but I would say it was the normal like just because I feel like the culture in America is like a new year open stuff. I feel like there's a lot of irresponsible like drinking and since like everything you have to drive everywhere unlike places in Europe where like it's needed at a younger age, but like you don't really own the cars. And I just feel like yeah like I already drinking and driving is a problem. And I feel like 21 is like a good age as you know like I mean 18 you also know what's good and what's bad, but I feel like 21 is like you have like you're in a thought with yeah. Yeah. So I don't know. I guess it depends because I get what you're saying at the same time. I don't feel like I don't know because of the culture. Like I don't know. I think. Yeah. Yeah. No, yeah, just I feel like that culture is because of our like high higher drinking age like because like it like makes it so that like when you're drinking under 21 which is very expected for most like US under 21 people like they're just going to like end up having a drink like and if it's illegal you're most likely not going to have that drink at like in a safe space like doing under the right conditions it's most likely going to be like at a party or like you don't really know like I don't know where it came from because you can't get it yourself safely. So like it's just kind of limiting the ability to have safe drinking habits by making it illegal until you're 21 because regardless of whether like the drinking age is 18 or 21 people are going to drink. So I think having at it at 18 would make it so that there are more like safe spaces for kids to drink or I would not kids but like it just makes more sense to have it so like people can find safe ways of drinking and learning about drinking where it's not them having to hide it and it's like illegal and people are nervous about it and like doing it in the wrong ways. I feel like that point that you brought up is actually a really good point. It does make sense I know. I feel like you know what you just said about if you can't drink then you're hiding in a safe space or you don't know where you know the op came from or who it came from because it's probably something that I purchased it. That makes a lot of sense you know like that's why I would take in between because I would like it I don't know but I also feel like I feel like I don't know you need to have more responsibility when you're close to drinking. Like obviously in a college campus if you have at least that community but I feel like outside and if you go other places it's a little bit more sensitive and so I'm going to say you know. Yeah I think it's interesting like I don't know to bring up like the responsibility part like when you're older like if you're 21 you like your like prefrontal cortex is more developed whatever like you're better at decision making that makes sense. I like completely agree but then like I would think that if you're going to have the drinking age of 21 you should also not be able to like go to war until 21 you can't do this until 21. I don't know why I keep saying going to war but like that's what I just keep thinking of. That's completely irrelevant. Yeah because I feel like I've heard people say like oh you can go off and like kill people for your country but you can't return and like drink a beer to celebrate you know like it's like what responsibilities like you're allowed to have versus like not allowed to have like it's just kind of like a double standard like if you're old enough to do like hold and fire a weapon at other people like I'm pretty sure you can handle your like drinking or like you should be expected to like it's just like I don't know. No like that's it's I feel like I wasn't going to bring up the like how your brain is more developed when you like your 21 suddenly you're better at making decisions and you know it's just scientific proven but it does make sense like that the double standard does exist and like like obviously like you said like you're able to like you know own a gun or like do all those things like you should be able to um yeah I mean I don't I feel like if the age like the drinking age changes to 18 I wouldn't be like completely opposed to it like it does make sense like I mean at the end of day you are an adult but I was just referring to like I mean if you go back like when I was in teen I wasn't as mature as I am now you know so I'm only 19 so I'm like basically I don't know but like the same as when I was 18 I would say but like when I'm 21 I feel like I'll definitely be more mature but I don't know if I would like make any better choices or anything just because like it's legal I don't know. But that makes sense and I also feel like having had a 18 would like allow like I mean we'll decrease the amount of like alcohol drinking I don't know. Yeah like I feel like um I don't know like drunk driving is such a horrible issue and like there's like definitely like like there definitely needs to be things like to prevent that but like I feel like I don't know if this is wrong like a lot of drunk drivers might be like underage I don't know if that's I don't know maybe that's just like a stigma in my mind because I feel like like I hear people being stupid and being like I can drink drive like whatever but like um I feel like people do that because it's like illegal you know like people are like oh this is cool like I'm not going to do it safely because drinking is already illegal but like I mean that doesn't really make sense but like theoretically if you're drunk and you're like already like not I don't know it just like makes drinking seem like this thing that like isn't safe already when it's illegal so it's like oh I'm like like gonna be stupid tonight stuff like that I don't know like just I feel like I don't know if it would help like or anything just making it like drinking legal at a younger age would help people be like smarter about it I don't even know if that would happen but like theoretically I feel like people do make dumorous decisions since like it is like illegal and like people have to hide it like in high school people would like have to drive home from parties because like their parents couldn't know you know which I mean high schools like much younger but like you have to hide things so you have to like worse decisions that's true but I was thinking like when you're 18 you don't really know how much you're capable of drinking you know like when you're young I mean it doesn't make it better when you're older like you still don't know but um I feel like like I was talking about how like the maturity that you have like making better decisions I was mentioning I was a point to mention exceptional assault and stuff especially because you know when you're younger and like you're drinking like you think this is like I don't know I feel like it leads to a lot of things that came like too harmful to yourself you know so it's too harmful to others but yeah I guess it depends on the person too so I don't want to like generalize yeah definitely hear those things all the time maybe I'm sticking to something but um yeah I guess everybody can do anything under the influence but I was just thinking like maybe I'm wrong but if you're older like you will make better decisions and like know the capacity of like how to control yourself and etc yeah but I feel like you kind of learned that through like trial and error like people are gonna figure that out their experience which you if like I mean I don't know either way like I don't think people are gonna wait until 21 yeah those always so it's it's like you I don't know you find out younger older but like you have to figure it out eventually through like trial and error so like the like I don't know it doesn't just come to you when you're older maybe no I agree with that like I mean everybody has strength you learn how to do those things but yeah I guess it makes sense so this yeah I feel like if it does happen like they choose to eat you it could like have those in common but I really feel like since everybody's doing that already there's not going to be much yeah I feel like a big point like I just like keep thinking about it's like there would just be more safe spaces to drink if it was younger because like college like I'm not going to be 21 until I'm a senior so like in college like I'm always underage and but I'm in an environment where it's like much more dangerous I don't know there's like not any safe spaces to drink and it's like all illegal versus when like um I don't know if it was more normalized or like something that was spoken about because like a lot of the issues I feel like with underage drinking like people are just told not to do it which I guess I feel like we did have a pretty good education about it like in like orientation or whatever I guess it's definitely getting better depends where you are where you like live and stuff but like a lot of the time if you're just told not to do something like you're still going to do it and then you just won't know how to do it safely so I feel like that's an issue with having an older um drinking age but it's also just like I just find it kind of random because I think I'm really the only country with like a 21 drinking age and even like Puerto Rico which is a US territory is 18 or like depends on like the place but it doesn't make sense I feel like I mean I feel like even now that is 21 it doesn't really change like a water like I mean wrong but like statistics and stuff so I think that if it like I said like if it does change then like I feel like it can be now that you bring up those points I feel like they're very simple. Yeah I'm sorry I'm going to tell you guys off there. Time's up. Please go back to the survey and you'll answer one last step questions once you're done. I'll tell you a little bit more about the study a little bit more about what we expect to find.\n",

      " Okay, let's get started with the next conversation for the next 10 minutes discuss some things you would take with you if you knew you would be stranded on a deserted island. Let's pretend that you together could only take a shoe box worth of things. Try to find things that you both agree on and talk about why you would take them. By the end of the conversation, you should both agree on a list of items to put in your shoe box. I'll let you know in 10 minutes or. The first thing I thought of was like a pocket knife. Oh yeah, that's yeah, definitely a lighter. Those are like super small too so like we can only take this shoe box that won't take that much space. Maybe like, I don't know, like if this would even work like something that would like filter water like even like a Brita filter without even work. I guess not like salt water. Yeah, I think that's a thing. And there's also like those things that come up with like, where you like just. Yeah, the straws. Yeah, like the straws. Yeah, then yeah, I think that would be something that you'd want to bring. Maybe some rope. Like a flashlight. Grat and night I don't think a lighter would really do the job. Yeah, yeah. I think I'm going to build fires. This would be kind of big but I feel like you want like a tarp or something like water resistant. I don't know, maybe just like a small tarp that like you could either use as like shelter or like to cover like, like what we have like, like our materials or like cover like wood if like to make a fire like you don't want it to be wet and stuff. Or like to sleep on the ground. Wait, sorry. I can't really hear you. Here we go. Yes. Maybe like just like a container to like, like, like a whole water like if we have to like water. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe like insect repellent. I don't even know if that'd be worth it at that point, but. No, I think so. Maybe sunscreen. Oh, yeah. You run out of it so quickly though. So it's like, what's the point? Oh, wait. A toothbrush. I wouldn't personally I wouldn't be that worried about brushing my teeth if we were stranded on it. Yeah. I mean, it'd be nice. I feel like. Yeah, that's not a priority. Yes. I just thought of something. Try to like look around like thinking about like what I use in my daily life, but I guess it's a lot different. Well, like a tele like myself. I feel like that could be helpful. Maybe a contest because we will be like in a deserted island. So I thought that there's going to be like. Yeah. I don't know. Like there's stuff that you can like, like not. Like I can't really use my cell phone. Like anywhere, but like there's there are like some phones, right? That like you can. I don't know. Take or like more like a walkie talkie thing that might be like able to connect to like. Boat nearby. Like my dad and I when we go out. I'm like boats in the summer will take like he bought like this walkie talkie that like will connect to like. The channels of boats like in the surrounding area. If we were at lost, I feel like that could work. I think there's more. But also that doesn't really. I don't know if that makes sense with the context like we're planning out going to a. Island. So like are we even are we trying to get saved at that point? Like I don't know. Maybe just survival. Yeah. We're just like a bag or something. Like carry stuff around and like gather food. Maybe seeds. We could like plan a little garden. Oh yes. I feel like that's harder than it sounds. Theoretically it sounds nice. My work. Like maybe scissors. If there was space in the box. Like we have the knife but scissors could also be used differently. Sorry. I can't hear you. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Definitely for like protection. That'd be smart. It works. Or like. If a taser. What? I don't know. I feel like it would be like kind of like how what the heck. Like continue attacking us. But. Wait. So we're going to be in a deserted island. There's no bears. Yeah. But we can worry about like I don't know. Some big cats. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I don't know. So maybe pepper spray and this taser. Like double whammy. Maybe something for like entertainment. I feel like we'd be super bored. I'm sure. I'm sure. Well, we might have a lot to do, but. No. Maybe I'd maybe I'd bring a book. I'd start reading. I would say like a net. Like to. Oh, that's a good one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That would be good. All right. She really compile this list so far. So like a lighter. A pocket knife. A net. He's a. He's a pepper spray. I don't like a container. Yeah. Container. Maybe a tarp. Kind of big. Book. I don't like it. I don't like it. Container. Yeah. Container. Maybe a tarp. Kind of big. Book. No, I won't think about that. We can just be bored. We can find our own entertainment. I'm forgetting what else. Seeds. Oh, yeah. Oh, the like filter straw. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I don't know what else we could do about. Yeah. I feel like food we have covered because like the net. The seeds. Yeah. Yeah. Lighter. So that would like, we have like cooked food on that and stuff. Yeah, and then like protection. We have Taser in pepper spray. Oh, yeah. If for shelter, I feel like the tarp in the rope maybe would help. It's also not a shoe box. I know, I know. I don't think half the stuff would fit in this. Yeah, so maybe not the tarp. I just keep thinking that would be like ideal. I guess you could like build a canopy with like leaves or something to. So water. One hot this camp. I had to build a shelter like using it was like. I went to like this overnight farm school camp and we had to. I did like a survival course while I was there, not like a course, but like. Just like a subsection of the camp and we had to just like build shelters out of like logs and sticks and like leaves and stuff. So that could work. And we wouldn't really have to bring anything. I think when I like used to do camping stuff, I like to learn how to do like fires with like a stick and like. Oh, yeah, we we also learned that, but I couldn't get it to work. So, it's very hard. Yeah. We don't be like sweating doing it for so long. Like it takes forever. And we had like the ideal like circumstances like it was literally like made to do it like and. Like we didn't like find the sticks or anything. It was like sticks that we had brought and like we use like cedar wood because it like catches easy and we like brought like. Tinder and stuff to light. I couldn't get it. So. You also use like a mirror. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. I said we could bring a mirror, but we already have the lighter. So I feel like. I'm going to cut you guys off there times up before you have your next conversation. You'll just need to answer a few more questions on the survey. So after you do that, please just move back into the spot that you're in.\n",

Yeah, then yeah, I think that would be something that you'd want to bring. Maybe some rope. Like a flashlight. Grat and night I don't think a lighter would really do the job. Yeah, yeah. I think I'm going to build fires. This would be kind of big but I feel like you want like a tarp or something like water resistant. I don't know, maybe just like a small tarp that like you could either use as like shelter or like to cover like, like what we have like, like our materials or like cover like wood if like to make a fire like you don't want it to be wet and stuff. Or like to sleep on the ground. Wait, sorry. I can't really hear you. Here we go. Yes. Maybe like just like a container to like, like a little bit of water. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe like insect repellent. I don't even know if that'd be worth it at that point. No, I think so. Oh yeah sunscreen. You run out of it so quickly though. So it's like, what's the point? Oh wait, a toothbrush. I wouldn't personally I wouldn't be that worried about brushing my teeth if we were stranded on it. That's what I want. Okay, we can leave that out. Yeah, I mean, it'd be nice. I feel like. Yeah, that's not a priority. Yes. I just thought of something. I'm trying to like look around like thinking about like what I use in my daily life, but I guess it's a lot different. Well, like a tele like myself. I feel like that could be helpful. Maybe a contest because we will be like in a deserted island. So I thought that there's no feelings. Yeah. I don't know. Like there's stuff that you can like, like not. Like I can't really use my cell phone. Like anywhere, but like there's there are like some phones, right? That like you can. I don't know. Take or like more like a walkie talkie thing that might be like able to connect to like. Boat nearby. Like my dad and I when we go out. And like boats in the summer will take like he bought like this walkie talking that like will connect to like the channels of boats, like in the surrounding area. If we were lost, I feel like that could work. But also that doesn't really, I don't know if that makes sense with the context like we're planning out going to a. Island. So like are we even are we trying to get saved at that point? Like I don't know. Maybe just survival. Yeah. We just like a bag or something. Like carry stuff around and like gather food. Maybe seeds. We could like plan a little garden. Oh, yes. I feel like that's harder than it sounds. Theoretically it sounds nice. My work. Like maybe scissors. Like we have the knife, but scissors could also be used differently. Okay. Sorry. I can't hear you. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, definitely for like protection. That'd be smart. I'm not going to have a taser. What? Oh, that'd be good. Yeah. Let's make a taser. Actually, if it was like a bear, would that even like stun it? I don't know. I feel like it'd just be like kind of like, how what the heck and like continue attacking us. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Wait, so we're going to be in a deserted island. Right. There's no bears. Yeah. But we can worry about like, I don't know. Some big cats. Yeah, I don't know. So maybe pepper spray and this taser. Like double whammy. Maybe something for like entertainment. Maybe I'd like to do it. Well, I might have a lot to do, but. No, maybe I'd maybe I'd bring a book. I'd start reading. I would say like a net. Like to. Oh, that's a good one. Yeah. Yeah, and that would be good. Okay. She really compile this list so far. So like a lighter. A pocket knife. A net. He's a. He's our pepper spray. I don't like a container. Yeah, container. Maybe a tarp. Kind of big. No, I won't think about that. We can just be bored. We can find our own entertainment. I'm forgetting what else. Seeds. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I don't know what else we could do about. Yeah, I feel like food we have covered because like the net. The seeds. Yeah, lighter. So that would like we have like cooks on that and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. And then like protection. We have Taser in pepper spray. Oh, we have a set of rope. Oh, yeah. If for shelter, I feel like the tarp in the rope. Maybe it would help. I know. I know. I know. I don't think half the stuff would fit in this. Yeah, so maybe not the tarp. I just keep thinking that would be like. Ideal. So you could like build a canopy. It's like leaves or something to. So water. One hot this camp. I had to build a shelter. I was like. I went to like this overnight farm school camp and we had to. I did like a survival course while I was there, not like a course, but like. Just like a subsection of the camp. And we had to just like build shelters out of like logs and sticks and like leaves and stuff. So that could work. And we wouldn't really have to bring anything. Since you have those skills. I, when I like used to do. I like to learn how to do like fires with like a stick and. Oh yeah, we, we also learned that, but I couldn't get it to work. So. Yeah. We don't be like sweating doing it for so long. Like it takes forever. And we had like the ideal, like. Circumstances, like it was literally like made to do it. Like, and. Like we didn't like find the sticks or anything. It was like, sticks that we had brought and like we used like cedar wood because it like catches easy and we like brought like. Tinder and stuff to light. I still couldn't get it. So. We also use like a mirror. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. I say we could bring a mirror, but we already have the lighter. So I feel like. I'm going to cut you guys off there. Time's up. Before you have your next conversation, you'll just need to answer a few more questions on the survey. So after you do that, please just move back into the spot that you're in.\n"
