Python based tutorials for interaction research data analysis.


# Tutorials
We created Jupyter Notebook tutorials to provide a step-by-step procedure to extract pose, audio, and transcripts from video recordings of interaction sessions.

* Tutorial 1 walks you through how OpenPose can be used to get body pose information form video recordings.
* Tutorial 2 walks you through how you can use OpenSMILE on audio files to get acoustic-prosodic information.
* Tutorial 3 walks you through how you can use whisper on audio files to get linguistic information.
