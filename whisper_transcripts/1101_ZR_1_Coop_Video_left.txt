 So, yes, three items that you would want to bring on an island. I'm assuming there can be any items or like a phone. Probably or something like that. Sorry. Sorry. Just to clarify, it's not three items. It's as many items you can fit in a shoe box. As many as you can fit in a shoe box. Okay. So a phone. Yes, it's small, too. So like we can definitely fit into the. Like multi purpose like it has a flashlight or also flashlight would be helpful to. Probably like a knife. Like to charge the phone. You need something at some point. Like affordable or one of those solar powered. Battery. Things. I'm assuming they'll have like a lot of food on the island. Like natural food. A lot. I mean, the phone, depending on where the island is, you might get serviced or night not. So. Walk you talky. Like a radio or something. Like a small handheld radio. Like a flare gun, maybe. Yes. Yeah. Also like something to be maybe a knife or like. Yeah, like a pocket knife or something. Uh huh. Like there's a watch on the phone usually. So I don't think anything like that. I'm trying to think to all like the movies I've seen of islands. Because probably. Some sort of. First aid kit. Yeah. Like bandages. Alcoholic wipes disinfectant and all that kind of stuff. Um. Um. What do you think about clothing? Would you. Like, you know, the ones you can just like. You can just. A small raincoat. Like just. Something like travel. You can just pack them in. Yeah. Or like. Like active wear. Dry suits. Um, like probably some. Shoes that are actually like. Usable, like not. I don't know. Like fancy issues, but like, you know, like. Maybe some crock or something. But like we might not be able to fit them into the. That's true. So. Um. Would you wear like the individual toe shoes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe like purse sunglasses. That's just like a accessory that it's not really needed. No. Yeah. Like we don't know the eye. The conditions of the item. So like. It is true. I think I like putting accessories as a little bit. Actually. Mm-hmm. Um, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe like purse sunglasses. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. That's a good point. We don't know the condition. So like a jacket or raincoat. Um, shorts and pants. Um, I guess sleeping bag. I guess sleeping bags. Not going to fit. But like a blanket sort of thing. Like one of those. Like small blankets that can like expand. Uh, Like a flint, maybe a flint to start a fire. Yeah. Also like maybe a water bottle. Um, like the other ones. Uh, but like they're flat and then I knew like feel some water to them. Like they just expand. There's the plastic bag ones. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Um, Do some of those in like maybe like the one that has a purifying technique. You know, Purifying straws or whatever. Um, Maybe like some. Energy bars or energy like. Because depending on where you how long it be stranded. Also medicine. We talked about first the first eight kids, but like some painkillers or like some. Yeah. Painkillers. Um, Maybe fishing line. Because assuming it's an island, they'll have like some sort of. Fish. And so you use a fishing line fishing hook. Not too big items. Like it's very small. So you can fit them. And. Um, Yeah. So you can fit. So you can fit them. And I'm. Um, I'm just trying to island. Well, so can you fit. So I'm assuming the goal is to get off this island at some point. Yeah. Would you take anything? I know we sort of flare gun in a phone. You take anything else to like. Get off the island. I don't know. But we also like included the flesh, flesh lights. So maybe. Some signals people. Yeah. Sure. Sensing. Yeah. I don't know. But we also like included the flesh. Flashlights. So. Maybe it's. Some signals. People. Yeah. Sure. Sensing. Yeah. Sure. Sensing. Like with the flarragon flashlight. Starfire with the flint. You could use. Like string. Potentially make a raft or something. I don't know. Um, like the knife as well. Yes. To use it to like. Make a tent to like sharpen the wood. Cut up leaves. Make yourself a house. I think that's a good idea. Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I feel like at this point, our shoe box is pretty full. But yeah, I guess. A raft. Like a house. How do you think you entertain yourself? I mean, if you have a phone, it's easier. But like if something happens to the phone. Maybe a small notepad and pencil might help. Okay. You can also like use it as a diary or just like keep track of the. Days. If. To the phone. I mean. I think the diary would be nice. Just keep track of what you did. Perhaps make a movie after afterwards. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. I think that's all I have. I mean. I like the idea of a diary. I think that's a little bit of a. Um. When you bring a book. Like a small book or is that like something you could probably find on your phone. You can download on your phone or something. Yeah. Um. But maybe like, you know, the travel size. Book. Maybe one of them. If you managed to innovate, you like. Into the box. Yeah. Um. I feel like bug spray would also be a good thing. That's something or sunscreen. Those are some things. Like a small travel side or something. Yeah. Also, like something that reminds this person of their home. Like this. Or emotional support. I don't know. Yeah. Like a big below. I don't know. I go watch. Or something with the photo. Yeah. We're saying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
