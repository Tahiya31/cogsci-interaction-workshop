 Okay, for the next 10 minutes, discuss some things you would take with you if you knew that you would be stranded on a deserted island. Let's present that you together can only take a shoebox worth of things. Try to find things that you both agree on and talk about why you should take them. By the end of the conversations, you should both agree on a list of items to put in your shoebox. I'll let you know when 10 minutes are up. She said 10 things or just like to fill a shoebox? 10 minutes. 10 minutes. But you have, yeah, just a shoebox worth of things. You can put as many things you want in the shoebox. Thank you. The first thing I was going to say was I'll bring my dog, but like I cannot finish shoebox. That would be a good thing to bring though. I don't know. I feel like it's hard to think of like small things. I don't know. Do you think of like useful things or things that are going to keep us empty things? I feel like you could need a good mixture of like both maybe. I'm also trying to do things that would fit in the shoebox. I feel like the water bottles that like it was so like pureed by the water. That would be smart. That would be smart. I feel like a knife would be really handy. Yes. Yeah. Like one of those with army knives. Yeah. All the tools. Yeah. Like matches and. Yeah. I would say a map would be helpful. But I also don't think it's like. That necessary for our survival, especially if we don't know where we are. Exactly. Yeah. I feel like if we brought like a journal. Like writing and then I mean. You have a lot of time. I feel like we explore the island. I mean, their own map, I guess. Yeah. Probably. Some type of maybe. I don't know. Food, I guess. For me, like the initial like first couple days. Like, I know I agree. At least like, I don't know materials for getting food, like. Be or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would say like books that you really like to. I mean, I think that's the only thing that can do entertain though. Okay. Loki sunscreen sunscreen. That's a good. I feel like once you get sunburned, especially if you're on the island in the sun all day. It's just miserable and probably. Bug spray. Yes. I agree with that. Flashlight. Flashlight. And. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe like a. Maybe like a flare gun or something. Oh, that's really smart. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe like. I don't know. Like paint brushes and stuff like like art supplies. Maybe I feel like that would be a good way to pass this time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Even like. It was just like photos of like. Loved ones. Oh, yeah. That's really smart. Feel like you like keypope or whatever. Yeah. That's really smart. It shows. Even like. It shows just like photos of like. Loved ones. Oh, yeah. That's really smart. Yeah. That's really smart. It shows would be really. I feel like that's a pretty good last. I know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like I really want like. It's like digits. Like the, like the little blocks or like the beats or just like something to like play with. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Like a, maybe like a little first aid. Get her something. Now I'm a little smart. Yeah. Disinfect or whatever. And then like. Yeah. Like a friend for like bandages or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's like maybe like a little like old radio. Yeah, it'd work. Like a radio for like music or like a radio. Like. Community people. I mean. I mean, I mean, I guess we can. For both. I would be ideal. music would be nice. I feel like it also depends on what's on this island. Exactly. It was an island or like. Did people live there at one point or. Yeah, I feel like. We're kind of be on our own. Not really sure how like. Radio frequencies work on deserted islands, but. Music the deaf things and nights. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I feel confident that we would survive. With materials that we bring in our shoe box. You too. Yeah. I feel like we can bring like small names. Like, I'm going to need like a scrabble board or something. Yeah. I feel like I'm going to be so bored. Yeah. Yeah. I don't really mean things that like. Ostotime. Like a ball. Maybe like a mini calendar. Two. No. Yeah. Okay. You guys time is up. Before you have your next conversation. Oh, wait. Okay. Yeah. Sorry. Okay. You guys times up. Please go back to computer. You'll answer one last set of questions. Once you're done, put your mask back on and come to the door. I will then tell you a little bit more about the study and what we expect to find before I let you go.
