 What do you think? So 21, I think it should stay on 21 considering the dumb amount of damage alcohol has on many people and also the brain development stages. So like the brain starts to, at least I think it's in women, it develops from some age, like 15 or something to 18 and then for guys it fully develops after 20 or 21. And so I think it's important for the development process to occur to a certain extent before people are legally allowed to drink. And I say that, but people are obviously drinking under age too so that's not like, necessarily stops but it definitely implies that there's a certain amount of time that you have to give for your brain to fully develop before you should start drinking. And so that's why I think 21 is an ideal age for people to start. And I also think that at 21 you're like, oh, I'm an adult, like you feel more an adult you have more responsibility. Most people are out of their moms and dads basement. So it's like, you have to be more assertive your decisions, especially when it comes to drinking so I think the opposite, like I think it should like, it should be 18 because people like, especially at colleges like their students have, you know, like drink all the time, especially at the weekends. So, but since they are not used to drinking. They just like some of them just start drinking when they get to college. So they sometimes get crazy about it, like, and just like because it's something that is new to them. So I think it's better just lower down the age and I think like, if it's legal maybe since if that's some, something is forbidden. And sometimes want to do it more. So also like I'm from Turkey, and in Turkey, the legal age of like drinking is 18. And I think, I don't know. Talk about biological aspect of it much. So you are right about the development mental process. It seems like people just don't, people are not aware of that already so I don't know how that would affect their decision of like drinking or not because like people are obviously, also aware of it. And most of them. So like, probably even like they know about it's probably they will continue drinking it, especially at especially college kids. Yeah, I do agree. I think regardless of whether you change it to 18 or 21. You're so gonna get the same group of people drinking. It's like not gonna change from it to change like, and I do agree with the sentiment where it's like when it's forbidden. People aspire to it, whether it's like breaking a lot like running a red light. Well, you do rental red light crazy. Being that kind of bad boy or breaking the rules kind of thing. And I was gonna ask like because Turkey obviously has like 18 and much of Europe really has like 16 or something that. And so there's a very loose. I guess law or retaliation against under a drinking in Europe and many other countries. I'm asking like if you drink under 18 or. I can. Oh, you can hear. Okay. I would say because in Europe, like a lot of people do drink under 18 right it's like 16 is usually where people start to get into like bars and clubs and people don't really stress the law as much. But I guess in America or something you would see like everyone's very strict on the 21 limit. I guess you're right in the sense that if you grow up with it or like start drinking at early age, it will. Like help you grow accustomed to it so you won't go overboard. But then there's also the cases where people start drinking heavy at 18 and then in 18 is a pretty, pretty like important age, especially coming into college and making a lot of bad decisions in high school. And so I think that's a good question to college can definitely like, call it your career or like hurt you developmentally and like as an independent student early on so that would just like. Negative, negatively affect you. I think most importantly, regardless of 18 to 21 it just you have a good influence where it comes to drinking the goods surrounding people friends. Like where you want how to pace and take your time. But yeah, I guess you have a different view on it because you are from a place where 18 is the limit so. Actually, you are right but for example in Turkey, it's actually like for example if you're under 18 you can't go into a club or a bar. Last varieties, or you can't buy drinks like maybe like if you're 17 or so and like if you look older people might might not ask for an idea but most of the time they ask it. So, but actually like after 18 since you can like going to a club easily. I agree that it's a little bit early to like expose yourself into that lifestyle. Like 18 is a, I mean, it is a young age. So it's better to maybe like, drink in your room or like with your, with a couple of couple of friends that you already know other than just like go to a club and drink with people you don't know. So yeah. So Turkey's has a lot of like Muslim population right so that definitely affects the drinking situation versus like other European countries, or 16 or 15 or something but Turkey and many other countries around are like, heavily mostly Muslim populated so that definitely probably affects it right. Actually like it depends. For example in Istanbul. Yes, there are like many Muslim people because like it's Turkey, Turkey's a Muslim country I mean, but especially in Istanbul like there are many people who are like really into going to nightclubs. And like there are also many non Muslim Muslim people living in especially in Istanbul because it's a very crowded and common put in city. So, yeah, maybe like some cities that affect its effects the condition but like most of the bars and nightclubs are also in big cities. So, and in big cities like there are also non Muslim people are like Muslim but not really religious people who are Muslim but who also like drinks. Yeah. So it's not like, I think it's, it's not a big factor. I mean, okay. Okay, I mean, I'm just curious, but. Yeah. Yeah. I think regardless of when it changes I think the same group of people will still like, like if you implement a rule now I don't think that the people who are doing ahead of time are going to change their mind or anything. So yeah, I think the same people would drink. I'll have the same sort of feel and sentiment on the college life and people in America. Yeah. That's all I have to say I guess I have opinions out but I guess there's interesting going in here, differing opinions. Yes. Are you from the US by the way. Yeah, so I'm from the US my parents are from India. So this is definitely a culturally different situation there too. So that's why I was wondering how it is in Turkey as well. So what's the like the age of drinking in India. I think it's 21. Oh, I'm sure but I know there's not a big heavy drinking culture. Obviously India has like, I think India has like the number one or number two and the most amount of Muslim population in the world. But again there's also been a lot of Hindus and culture is like, not as much drinking heavy too. So, yeah. Very different from the Western society.
