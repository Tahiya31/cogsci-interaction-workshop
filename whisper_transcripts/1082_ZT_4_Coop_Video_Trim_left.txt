 Okay. Survival, I guess. We need a knife. Yes, yes, absolutely. Necessary. We need a lighter. Yes. Yes. A lighter is important to start fires. Oh. Oh. What else? I guess. We would need something to like contact people by. Um, Radio, you're working. I don't know. I don't know. It works on this field. I like honestly, like maybe. Nothing works because like walkie-talkies, they have like, you need to be in the same frequency with somebody else. So not very far. And radio, if we are in the deserted island, we would have really be able to use it. Yeah, maybe, maybe like a flare. It's like a go like from close enough. And then there is a gun that suits. Yeah, a flare. That's nice. Oh. I think it's like a small pot or something. Like what, sir? Like a small pot. Oh. I was thinking, um, a first aid kit. Oh, yes. How big is the box? I don't, I maybe like this size. Okay. Yeah. I think that's all. I mean, okay. What have we put so far? We have put the first aid kit. Yeah. We have put a knife, a lighter, the gun. We can definitely take a pot to boil water. Yes. We still have some space on it. Don't. Okay. Okay. Oh. What else do you need to survive? Well, we assume that there will be food in the island, but you never know. Yeah. We can take a role. We can take a role. We can take a role. We can take a role. We can take a role. We can take a role. We can take a role. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Maybe a flashlight, but yes. That's my rope. We still have some, a little bit of space left like these ones. Okay. You can, we can bring something to remind ourselves or a family, you know, some sentimental item. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, um, so there is the thing that you make holes in the ground, so you can go and poop and pee when you are outdoors. Oh, yeah. We would need that. We are in the search the driver. Yeah, that's true. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. We will need that. We are in the search the driver. Yeah. That's true. Would that fill the shoe box? Yes. It's, it's small. It's like this big. Okay. Okay. Oh, yeah. Okay. But that's only take. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Something in terms of food. So we can, you know, have enough time to find food on the island. Yeah. I mean, yeah, maybe just like emergency rations until like we can like make a net or something to fish. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe a small blanket or something warm. Oh, yeah. But we can see that in the box. And I think we're pretty mad set. Yeah. I think that'd be everything. Yeah. I think that we've survived. Do well. Worst case to die. Yeah, that's true. Worst case. We just give up on the island and chop down some trees and try to build a raft and some away. Yeah. We'll have to have a little more thing or the whole box. Like we said. I think we're set. Yeah. How long do you think you've been lost? Oh, it depends the island. It's like the island. I think we're set. I think we're set. Okay. Yeah. How long do you think you've been lost? Oh, it depends the island. It depends the island. If the island has nothing like desert desert, you can survive. Yeah. Yeah. If there are trees and maybe some fruits and something. Yeah. I think you can push it for like one or two weeks. The problem is also the water. Is there a water supply because you can't drink seawater? Yeah. Oh, maybe we should have thought about it. Yeah. Oh, maybe we should have thought filtration. Yeah. Water. We can stack it. Yeah. We can boil it in the pot. Yeah. We would put, we can have like plastic bags and put them around the leaves. So we can do it. Yeah. We can, we can like drink the water from like tree, like branches or something. So. Yes. I think it's like $1. I think $1. I think we're in the same clothes for like the entire time that we're stranded there. Yeah. I don't care. She's just taken a walk. He was left. He's going to dry. He wears on my kid. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, you're stranded on the island. What can you do? Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yeah. In the case that we land on an island with a relatively. A good number of trees and food. I think that we have. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. good. Yeah. And I have the right right weather, you know, it can't be like freezing cold either. I know. That's bad. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. The main island in the winter would be deadly. That's gonna be bad. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're all set. Yes, we are all set. We are ready for the island. Yes, we are. We're ready to go to live our life. And it's gonna be vacation. And so it's gonna be it's probably not nice. We're gonna have the time of our life. Oh, yes. Okay guys, your time is
